  abstract = {Multipath propagation causes major impairments to global positioning
	system (GPS) based navigation. Multipath results in biased GPS measurements,
	hence inaccurate position estimates. In this paper, multipath effects
	are considered as abrupt changes affecting the navigation system.
	A multiple model formulation is proposed whereby the changes are
	represented by a discrete valued process. The detection of the errors
	induced by multipath is handled by a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter
	(RBPF). The RBPF estimates the indicator process jointly with the
	navigation states and multipath biases. The interest of this approach
	is its ability to integrate a priori constraints about the propagation
	environment. The detection is improved by using information from
	near future GPS measurements at the particle filter (PF) sampling
	step. A computationally modest delayed sampling is developed, which
	is based on a minimal duration assumption for multipath effects.
	Finally, the standard PF resampling stage is modified to include
	an hypothesis test based decision step},

  abstract = {Interference are among the most penalizing error sources in global
	positioning system (GPS) navigation. So far, many effort has been
	devoted to developing GPS receivers more robust to the radio-frequency
	environment. Contrary to previous approaches, this paper does not
	aim at improving the estimation of the GPS pseudoranges between the
	mobile and the GPS satellites in the presence of interference. As
	an alternative, we propose to model interference effects as variance
	jumps affecting the GPS measurements which can be directly detected
	and compensated at the level of the navigation algorithm. Since the
	joint detection/estimation of the interference errors and motion
	parameters is a highly non linear problem, a particle filtering technique
	is used. An original particle filter is developed to improve the
	detection performance while ensuring a good accuracy of the positioning
	solution.},

	A new peak-finding algorithm is developed to search the C/A code
	phase in the FFT-based correlation domain. This method can estimate
	the peak location accurately and provides a faster performance in
	the software-based signal acquisition. The integration time deciding
	algorithm is also utilized to enhance the capability of waveform

	the power level of-155 dBm in frequency domain processing.},
