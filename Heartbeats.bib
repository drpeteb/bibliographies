  abstract = {Fetal electrocardiogram signals from abdominal recordings were digitized
	and processed by a personal computer. An averaged maternal signal
	was derived from the cross-correlation function and nonrecursive
	digital filtering. The cross-correlation function was calculated
	from the cross-spectrum and the fast Fourier transform algorithm.
	The maximum value of the cross-correlation function and the time
	location of that value were found by (1) searching for the similarity
	between the waveforms (for elimination of artifacts) and (2) measuring
	the relative time delay (for the waveform's alignment in the averaging
	process) between the ECG waveforms. Prior to this procedure each,
	of the ECG waveforms was filtered through a nonrecursive digital
	high-pass filter. With this procedure a template signal corresponding
	to one complete maternal ECG signal is obtained. The fetal ECG and
	the electromyogram (EMG) are suppressed in the maternal template
	waveform, since they are not correlated with the maternal ECG. The
	averaged maternal ECG was then subtracted from the abdominal signals.
	The subtraction results in, complete elimination of the maternal
	signal, thus it is possible to detect all of the fetal QRS complexes
	in spite of their coincidence with the maternal ECG. An averaged
	fetal ECG is then extracted using the same averaging process to improve
	the signal-to-noise ratio, making it possible to recognize fetal
	P and T waves. The performance of this method was assessed using
	simulated and recorded (real) abdominal ECG signals. This method
	shows a significant improvement with respect to detection of fetal
	heart rate, evaluation of short-term variation in the heart rate
	and detection of arrhythmia disturbances in the fetal ECG. The averaging
	procedure to obtain the averaged fetal waveform can be used to study
	long-term alterations in the fetal ECG},

  abstract = {The cross-correlation function for alignment of ECG waveforms and
	rejection of artifacts was studied. ECG waveforms were recorded and
	digitized (10-bit resolution) at 1.28 KHz and were processed with
	a CDC 6600 computer. The cross-correlation function was calculated
	using the cross spectrum and the fast Fourier transform algorithm.
	The maximum value of the cross-correlation function and the time
	location of that value were searched for (a) the similarity between
	the waveforms (for elimination of extrasystoles), and (b) measuring
	the relative time delay (for the waveform's alignment in the averaging
	process) between the ECG waveforms. Prior to the correlation procedure
	each of the ECG waveforms was filtered through a nonrecursive digital
	bandpass filter. Experiments with various filters indicated that
	when low-frequency cutoff at 30 Hz and high-frequency cutoff at 250
	Hz were used the maximum value of the cross-correlation function
	was higher than 0.9 for most of our recorded waveforms and more accurate
	results were obtained.},

  abstract = {Waveforms are often sampled faster than the Nyquist rate to obtain
	desired temporal resolution, even though, theoretically, oversampling
	adds no information and should not be necessary. This paper shows
	how high resolution can be achieved efficiently from data sampled
	at the Nyquist rate by working with coefficients of the Fourier-series
	expansion of the continuous interpolating waveform. Practical algorithms
	are presented for aligning and comparing waveforms, locating peaks,
	resolving superimpositions, and averaging overlapping waveforms.
	The algorithms prove to be more accurate, and to require fewer computations
	and less storage than techniques which employ continuous oversampling
	in many signal-processing applications, particularly template matching.},
