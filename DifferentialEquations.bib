  abstract = {Kalman filters have been used in numerous phased array radars to track
	satellites, reentry vehicles, and missiles. This paper considers
	the design of these filters to reduce computational requirements,
	ill-conditioning, and the effects of nonlinearities. Several special
	coordinate systems used to represent the Kalman filter error covariance
	matrix are described. These covariance coordinates facilitate the
	approximate decoupling required for practical filter design. A tutorial
	discussion and analysis of ill-conditioning in Kalman filters is
	used to motivate these design considerations. This analysis also
	explains several well-known phenomena reported in the literature.
	In addition, a discussion of nonlinearities and methods to mitigate
	their ill effects is included.},
