  title = {A Smoothness Priors-State Space Modeling of Time Series with Trend
	and Seasonality},
  journal = {Journal of the American Statistical Association},
  year = {1984},
  volume = {79},
  pages = {pp. 378-389},
  number = {386},
  abstract = {A smoothness priors modeling of time series with trends and seasonalities
	is shown. An observed time series is decomposed into local polynomial
	trend, seasonal, globally stationary autoregressive and observation
	error components. Each component is characterized by an unknown variance-white
	noise perturbed difference equation constraint. The constraints or
	Bayesian smoothness priors are expressed in state space model form.
	Trading day factors are also incorporated in the model. A Kalman
	predictor yields the likelihood for the unknown variances (hyperparameters).
	Likelihoods are computed for different constraint order models in
	different subsets of constraint equation model classes. Akaike's
	minimum AIC procedure is used to select the best model fitted to
	the data within and between the alternative model classes. Smoothing
	is achieved by using a fixed-interval smoother algorithm. Examples
	are shown.},
