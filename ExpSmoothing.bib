  Abstract                 = { An innovations state space modeling framework is introduced for forecasting complex seasonal time series such as those with multiple seasonal periods, high-frequency seasonality, non-integer seasonality, and dual-calendar effects. The new framework incorporates Box–Cox transformations, Fourier representations with time varying coefficients, and ARMA error correction. Likelihood evaluation and analytical expressions for point forecasts and interval predictions under the assumption of Gaussian errors are derived, leading to a simple, comprehensive approach to forecasting complex seasonal time series. A key feature of the framework is that it relies on a new method that greatly reduces the computational burden in the maximum likelihood estimation. The modeling framework is useful for a broad range of applications, its versatility being illustrated in three empirical studies. In addition, the proposed trigonometric formulation is presented as a means of decomposing complex seasonal time series, and it is shown that this decomposition leads to the identification and extraction of seasonal components which are otherwise not apparent in the time series plot itself. },

  Abstract                 = {A smoothness priors modeling of time series with trends and seasonalities is shown. An observed time series is decomposed into local polynomial trend, seasonal, globally stationary autoregressive and observation error components. Each component is characterized by an unknown variance-white noise perturbed difference equation constraint. The constraints or Bayesian smoothness priors are expressed in state space model form. Trading day factors are also incorporated in the model. A Kalman predictor yields the likelihood for the unknown variances (hyperparameters). Likelihoods are computed for different constraint order models in different subsets of constraint equation model classes. Akaike's minimum AIC procedure is used to select the best model fitted to the data within and between the alternative model classes. Smoothing is achieved by using a fixed-interval smoother algorithm. Examples are shown.},
