	state-space models is a long-standing problem. This is despite the
	advent of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, aka particle filters) methods,
	which provide very good approximations to the optimal filter under
	weak assumptions. Several algorithms based on SMC have been proposed
	in the past 10 years to solve the static parameter problem. However
	all the algorithms we are aware of suffer from the so-called `degeneracy
	problem'. We propose here a methodology for point estimation of static
	parameters which does not suffer from this problem. Our methods take
	advantage of the fact that many state space models of interest are
	ergodic and stationary: this allows us to propose contrast functions
	for the static parameter which can be consistently estimated and
	optimised using simulation-based methods. Several types of contrast
	functions are possible but we focus here on the average of a so-called
	pseudo-likelihood which we maximize using on-line Expectation-Maximization
	type algorithms. In its basic form the algorithm requires the expression
	of the invariant distribution of the underlying state process. When
	the invariant distribution is unknown, we present an alternative
	which relies on indirect inference techniques.},

  abstract = {Two-filter smoothing is a principled approach for performing optimal
	smoothing in non-linear non-Gaussian statespace models where the
	smoothing distributions are computed through the combination of forward
	and backward time filters. The forward filter is the standard
	Bayesian filter but the backward filter, generally referred to
	as the backward information filter, is not a probability measure
	on the space of the hidden Markov process. In cases where the backward
	information filter can be computed in closed form, this technical
	point is not important. However, for general statespace models where
	there is no closed form expression, this prohibits the use of flexible
	numerical techniques such as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to approximate
	the two-filter smoothing formula. We propose here a generalised two-filter
	smoothing formula which only requires approximating probability distributions
	and applies to any statespace model, removing the need to make restrictive
	assumptions used in previous approaches to this problem. SMC algorithms
	are developed to implement this generalised recursion and we illustrate
	their performance on various problems.},

	Conditional on jump times, we derive closed-form transition densities

	simulation from posterior distributions. These methods are of particular
	interest in Bayesian filtering for discrete time dynamic models that
	are typically nonlinear and non-Gaussian. A general importance sampling
	framework is developed that unifies many of the methods which have
	been proposed over the last few decades in several different scientific
	disciplines. Novel extensions to the existing methods are also proposed.
	We show in particular how to incorporate local linearisation methods
	similar to those which have previously been employed in the deterministic
	filtering literature; these lead to very effective importance distributions.
	Furthermore we describe a method which uses Rao-Blackwellisation
	in order to take advantage of the analytic structure present in some
	important classes of state-space models. In a final section we develop
	algorithms for prediction, smoothing and evaluation of the likelihood
	in dynamic models.},

	(MCMC) moves within a particle filter. Previous, similar, attempts
	have required the complete history (trajectory) of each particle

	within a particle filter when only summaries of each particles' trajectory
	are stored. These summaries are based on sufficient statistics. Using
	this idea, the storage requirement of the particle filter can be
	substantially reduced, and MCMC moves can be implemented more efficiently.
	We illustrate how this idea can be used for both the bearingsonly
	tracking problem and a model of stochastic volatility. We give a
	detailed comparison of the performance of different particle filters
	for the bearings-only tracking problem. MCMC, combined with a sensible
	initialization of the filter and stratified resampling, produces

	and models for tracking of manoeuvring objects in clutter. The methods
	develop on the basic variable dimension particle filtering algorithms
	introduced in S.J. Godsill and J. Vermaak (2004), in which a new
	type of dynamical model is introduced whose state variables arrive
	at unknown times relative to the observation process (hence 'variable
	rate'). Targets are assumed to follow deterministic trajectories
	in between state times, determined by an appropriate model, such
	as the differential equation model for the object. The framework
	allows for automatic modelling and estimation of the trajectories
	of targets using an adaptation of particle filtering methods (A.
	Doucet et al., 2000) into the variable dimension setting. In this
	paper we introduce more effective sampling schemes for the variable
	rate setting that ensure future states are only generated as and
	when required, new dynamical models appropriate for manoeuvring objects,
	and new observation models under the assumption of a nonhomogeneous
	Poisson process for both targets and clutter. Simulations show very
	effective tracking performance under challenging settings which cannot
	be emulated in a standard fixed rate scheme},

  abstract = {The Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most widely used methods for
	tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability
	and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems
	can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended
	Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearizes all nonlinear models
	so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although
	the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy,
	over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus
	within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to
	implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which
	are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this
	paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using
	the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used
	to parameterize mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance
	equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalizes elegantly
	to nonlinear systems without the linearization steps required by
	the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the
	new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly
	comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is
	not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources
	are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate
	estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the
	EKF in virtually all applications.},

	Since nonlinear and non-Gaussian estimation problems are solved approximately
	in an optimal way using recursive Monte Carlo methods or particle
	filters, the association step is crucial for the overall performance.
	We introduce a Bayesian data association method based on the particle
	filter idea and joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) hypothesis
	calculations. A comparison with classical EKF based data association
	methods such as the nearest neighbor (NN) method and the JPDA method
	is made. The NN association method is also applied to the particle
	filter method. Multiple target tracking using particle filtering
	increases the computational burden, therefore a control structure
	for the number of samples needed is proposed. A radar target tracking
	application is used in a simulation study for evaluation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Almost all research fields in geosciences use numerical models
	and observations and combine these using data-assimilation techniques.
	With ever-increasing resolution and complexity, the numerical models
	tend to be highly nonlinear and also observations become more complicated
	and their relation to the models more nonlinear. Standard data-assimilation
	techniques like (ensemble) Kalman filters and variational methods
	like 4D-Var rely on linearizations and are likely to fail in one
	way or another. Nonlinear data-assimilation techniques are available,
	but are only efficient for small-dimensional problems, hampered by
	the so-called curse of dimensionality. Here we present a fully
	nonlinear particle filter that can be applied to higher dimensional
	problems by exploiting the freedom of the proposal density inherent
	in particle filtering. The method is illustrated for the three-dimensional
	Lorenz model using three particles and the much more complex 40-dimensional
	Lorenz model using 20 particles. By also applying the method to the
	1000-dimensional Lorenz model, again using only 20 particles, we
	demonstrate the strong scale-invariance of the method, leading to
	the optimistic conjecture that the method is applicable to realistic
	geophysical problems. Copyright © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

  abstract = {In this paper we present an online approach for joint detection and
	tracking for multiple targets using variable rate particle filters
	(VRPFs). Unlike conventional models and particle filters, the proposed
	method utilises the applied forces (tangential and radial components)
	to model target motions and does not assume the hidden state to change
	at the same rate as the observations. In effect not only does the
	proposed method enable us to model parsimoniously the manoeuvring
	behaviours of targets with a single dynamical model but it also provides
	a more efficient framework for recursive estimation of the targets'
	positions since much fewer states will be estimated. In addition,
	a target detection/termination module will be integrated in the proposed
	method in which a track initiation, termination, or maintenance move
	is randomly executed using Bayesian Monte Carlo methods. To model
	a more realistic observation environment Poisson process is chosen
	for all target originating and spurious measurements. Unlike other
	observation models, the proposed model does not require extensive
	computation for data association between active targets and observations,
	prior to target state estimation, as a result. To improve the quality
	of the particles we adopt a data-dependent importance sampling strategy
	in which the latest observations are involved when new particles
	are updated. This enables the target states to be updated as new
	observations arrive while keeping the number of states sufficiently
	low to track the manoeuvres of the targets. Computer simulations
	demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for detecting and
	tracking multiple highly manoeuverable targets in a hostile environment
	with high clutter density and low detection probability.},

	approach is based on approximating the target posterior by a mixture
	of fixed lag smoothing distributions. Parameter inference exploits
	a sufficient statistic structure and the methodology can be easily
	implemented by modifying state space smoothing algorithms. We avoid
	reweighting particles and hence sample degeneracy problems that plague
	particle filters that use sequential importance sampling. The method
	is illustrated by using two examples: a benchmark auto-regressive
	model with observation error and a high dimensional dynamic spatiotemporal
	model. We show that the method provides accurate inference in the
	presence of outliers, model misspecification and high dimensionality.},

	the  method degrades quickly, as it relies on the approximation of

	the variance of the estimates computed with the  method increases
	at least quadratically in time. The more expensive  method relies
	on a nonstandard particle implementation and does not suffer from
	this rapid degradation. It is shown how both methods can be used

	to that of the EKF: the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Three application
	areas of nonlinear estimation in which the EKF has been applied are
	covered as follows: state estimation, parameter estimation, and dual
	estimation. An overview of the framework for these areas is briefly
	reviewed.},
