  abstract = {A ballistocardiograph records the mechanical activity of the heart.
	We present a novel algorithm for the detection of individual heart
	beats and beat-to-beat interval lengths in ballistocardiograms (BCGs)
	from healthy subjects. An automatic training step based on unsupervised
	learning techniques is used to extract the shape of a single heart
	beat from the BCG. Using the learned parameters, the occurrence of
	individual heart beats in the signal is detected. A final refinement
	step improves the accuracy of the estimated beat-to-beat interval
	lengths. Compared to many existing algorithms, the new approach offers
	heart rate estimates on a beat-to-beat basis. The agreement of the
	proposed algorithm with an ECG reference has been evaluated. A relative
	beat-to-beat interval error of 1.79% with a coverage of 95.94% was
	achieved on recordings from 16 subjects.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel blind-source separation method to
	extract fetal ECG from a single-channel signal measured on the abdomen
	of the mother. The signal is a mixture of the fetal ECG, the maternal
	ECG and noise. The key idea is to project the signal into higher
	dimensions, and then use an assumption of statistical independence
	between the components to separate them from the mixtures. This is
	achieved by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) on the spectrogram,
	followed by an iterated application of independent component analysis
	(ICA) on the principle components. The SVD contributes to the separability
	of each component and the ICA contributes to the independence of
	the two components. We further refine and adapt the above general
	idea to ECG by exploiting a-prior knowledge of the maternal ECG frequency
	distribution and other characteristics of ECG. Experimental studies
	show that the proposed method is more accurate than using SVD only.
	Because our method does not exploit extensive domain knowledge of
	the ECGs, the idea of combining SVD and ICA in this way can be applied
	to other blind separation problems.},

  abstract = {Fetal heart rate extraction from the abdominal ECG is of great importance
	due to the information that carries in assessing appropriately the
	fetus well-being during pregnancy. In this work a novel automated
	method is presented for the detection of the QRS complexes of the
	fetus cardiac activity using multichannel maternal ECG recordings.
	No accessory preprocessing step for noise filtering is required.
	The method is based on the complex continuous wavelet transform and
	modulus maxima theory. The proposed method was validated using real
	signals, recorded at different weeks of gestation, covering most
	of the pregnancy period. The system performs well, since almost all
	fetal beats are detected (accuracy: 99.5%).},

  title = {A respiratory latent variable model for mechanically measured heartbeats},
  journal = {Physiological Measurement},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {31},
  pages = {1331},
  number = {10},
  abstract = {The effect of respiration on heartbeats in a mechanically measured
	cardiac signal was noticed already in the first respiratory ballistocardiography
	studies in the 1920s. The effect was described as a modulation of
	the heartbeat amplitude, and that view has persisted. Although a
	reasonable approximation, amplitude modulation is not an accurate
	description of the respiratory effect. In this paper, the respiratory
	variation is described with a linear latent variable model, where
	the direction of variation can be distinct from the direction of
	amplitude. The model was evaluated with seven ballistocardiograms
	from three healthy test subjects. Based on a Bayesian information
	criterion analysis, it was found to describe the variation accurately
	in all the cases. As the modelling of the heartbeat shape is improved,
	existing heartbeat detection methods can be made more accurate by
	applying the proposed model.},
