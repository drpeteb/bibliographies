An original Bayesian model is proposed that allows us to define a posterior distribution on the parameter space. All Bayesian inference is then based on this distribution. Unfortunately, a direct evaluation of this distribution and of its features, including posterior model probabilities, requires evaluation of some complicated high-dimensional integrals. We develop an efficient stochastic algorithm based on reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to perform the Bayesian computation. A convergence result for this algorithm is established. In simulation, it appears that the performance of detection based on posterior model probabilities outperforms conventional detection schemes },

  Abstract                 = {Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo methods have emerged as the two main tools to sample from high dimensional probability distributions. Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to build efficient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so. We demonstrate these algorithms on a non-linear state space model and a Lévy-driven stochastic volatility model.},

  Abstract                 = { The estimation of static parameters in general non-linear non-Gaussian state-space models is a long-standing problem. This is despite the advent of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, aka particle filters) methods, which provide very good approximations to the optimal filter under weak assumptions. Several algorithms based on SMC have been proposed in the past 10 years to solve the static parameter problem. However all the algorithms we are aware of suffer from the so-called `degeneracy problem'. We propose here a methodology for point estimation of static parameters which does not suffer from this problem. Our methods take advantage of the fact that many state space models of interest are ergodic and stationary: this allows us to propose contrast functions for the static parameter which can be consistently estimated and optimised using simulation-based methods. Several types of contrast functions are possible but we focus here on the average of a so-called pseudo-likelihood which we maximize using on-line Expectation-Maximization type algorithms. In its basic form the algorithm requires the expression of the invariant distribution of the underlying state process. When the invariant distribution is unknown, we present an alternative which relies on indirect inference techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a new nonlinear filter for high-dimensional state estimation, which we have named the cubature Kalman filter (CKF). The heart of the CKF is a spherical-radial cubature rule, which makes it possible to numerically compute multivariate moment integrals encountered in the nonlinear Bayesian filter. Specifically, we derive a third-degree spherical-radial cubature rule that provides a set of cubature points scaling linearly with the state-vector dimension. The CKF may therefore provide a systematic solution for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering problems. The paper also includes the derivation of a square-root version of the CKF for improved numerical stability. The CKF is tested experimentally in two nonlinear state estimation problems. In the first problem, the proposed cubature rule is used to compute the second-order statistics of a nonlinearly transformed Gaussian random variable. The second problem addresses the use of the CKF for tracking a maneuvering aircraft. The results of both experiments demonstrate the improved performance of the CKF over conventional nonlinear filters.},

  Abstract                 = {Product partition models assume that observations in different components of a random partition of the data are independent. If the probability distribution of random partitions is in a certain product form prior to making the observations, it is also in product form given the observations. The product model thus provides a convenient machinery for allowing the data to weight the partitions likely to hold; and inference about particular future observations may then be made by first conditioning on the partition and then averaging over all partitions. These models apply with special computational simplicity to change point problems, where the partitions divide the sequence of observations into components within which different regimes hold. We show, with appropriate selection of prior product models, that the observations can eventually determine approximately the true partition.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: We have used state-space models (SSMs) to reverse engineer transcriptional networks from highly replicated gene expression profiling time series data obtained from a well-established model of T cell activation. SSMs are a class of dynamic Bayesian networks in which the observed measurements depend on some hidden state variables that evolve according to Markovian dynamics. These hidden variables can capture effects that cannot be directly measured in a gene expression profiling experiment, for example: genes that have not been included in the microarray, levels of regulatory proteins, the effects of mRNA and protein degradation, etc.Results: We have approached the problem of inferring the model structure of these state-space models using both classical and Bayesian methods. In our previous work, a bootstrap procedure was used to derive classical confidence intervals for parameters representing genegene interactions over time. In this article, variational approximations are used to perform the analogous model selection task in the Bayesian context. Certain interactions are present in both the classical and the Bayesian analyses of these regulatory networks. The resulting models place JunB and JunD at the centre of the mechanisms that control apoptosis and proliferation. These mechanisms are key for clonal expansion and for controlling the long term behavior (e.g. programmed cell death) of these cells.Availability: Supplementary data is available at http://public.kgi.edu/wild/index.htm and Matlab source code for variational Bayesian learning of SSMs is available at http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/mbeal/software.htmlContact: David_Wild@kgi.edu},

  Abstract                 = {In a conventional particle filter, the information update step can suffer from particle degeneracy if the likelihood function is concentrated on only a few particles. The homotopy particle flow method has been developed to implement the information update in an entirely different manner by using a particle flow function to migrate the particles to regions of the target state space that provide a good representation of the posterior distribution. In this paper we demonstrate how the homotopy particle filter can be implemented with the JPDA and MAP-PF multi-target tracking algorithms, and compare performance to the conventional resampling method.},

The benchmark problem involves beam pointing control of a phased array (i.e., agile beam) radar against highly maneuvering targets in the presence of false alarms (FAs) and electronic counter measurements (ECM). The testbed simulation described includes the effects of target amplitude fluctuations, beamshape, missed detections, FAs, finite resolution, target maneuvers, and track loss. Multiple waveforms are included in the benchmark so that the radar energy can be coordinated with the tracking algorithm. The ECM includes a standoff jammer (SOJ) broadcasting wideband noise and targets attempting range gate pull off (RGPO). The limits on the position and maneuverability of the targets are given along with descriptions of six target trajectories. The ldquo;best rdquo; tracking algorithm is the one that minimizes a weighted average of the radar energy and radar time, while satisfying a constraint of 4% on the maximum number of lost tracks, The radar model, the ECM techniques, the target scenarios, and performance criteria for the benchmark are presented},

A novel approach to hypotheses merging is presented for this problem. The novelty lies in the timing of hypotheses merging.

Evaluation of the IMM algorithm shows that it performs well at a relatively low computational load.

The principle used for switching detection is based on finding projected subspaces from batches of input-output data, which are taken from the full data set. The method runs off-line, incrementally over all the data and, at each time, a different batch is used to compute the projected subspace. In this way, the segmentation and classification of data are entirely based on the information retrieved from the projected subspace, i.e. the subspace dimension and basis. The output of the method is a matrix of weights that assigns each pair of input-output measured data to the respective local system. Simulation experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Two-filter smoothing is a principled approach for performing optimal smoothing in non-linear non-Gaussian statespace models where the smoothing distributions are computed through the combination of forward and backward time filters. The forward filter is the standard Bayesian filter but the backward filter, generally referred to as the backward information filter, is not a probability measure on the space of the hidden Markov process. In cases where the backward information filter can be computed in closed form, this technical point is not important. However, for general statespace models where there is no closed form expression, this prohibits the use of flexible numerical techniques such as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to approximate the two-filter smoothing formula. We propose here a generalised two-filter smoothing formula which only requires approximating probability distributions and applies to any statespace model, removing the need to make restrictive assumptions used in previous approaches to this problem. SMC algorithms are developed to implement this generalised recursion and we illustrate their performance on various problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle filtering and smoothing algorithms approximate posterior state distributions with a set of samples drawn from those distributions. Conventionally, samples from the joint smoothing distribution are generated by sequentially resampling from the particle filter results. If the number of filtering particles is high, this process is limited by computational complexity. In addition, the support of the smoothing distribution is restricted to the values which appear in the filtering approximation. In this paper, a Metropolis-Hastings sampling procedure is used to improve the efficiency of the particle smoother, achieving comparable error performance but with a lower execution time. In addition, an algorithm for approximating the joint smoothing distribution without limited support is presented, which achieves simultaneous improvements in both execution time and error. These algorithms also provide a greater degree of flexibility over existing methods, allowing a trade-off between execution time and error, controlled by the length of the Markov chains.},

For such cases, a variable rate model may be more appropriate; the system dynamics are conditioned on a set of random changepoints which constitute a marked point process. In this paper, new particle smoothing algorithms are presented for use with conditionally linear-Gaussian and conditionally deterministic dynamics.

The performance of a standard particle filter is highly dependent on the choice of importance density used to propagate the particles through time. The conditional posterior state density is the optimal choice, but this can rarely be calculated analytically or sampled from exactly. Practical particle filters rely on forming approximations to the optimal importance density, frequently using Gaussian distributions, but these are not always effective in highly nonlinear models. The composite proposal method introduces the effect of each observation gradually and incrementally modifies the particle states so as to achieve an improved approximation to the optimal importance distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of tracking moving targets is often handled by modelling using hidden Markov models. This approach is attractive because it allows standard algorithms to be used, including the Kalman filter and particle filter. However, it often ignores a significant amount of temporal structure in the path of a manoeuvring target. Variable rate models treat the target motion as deterministic when conditioned upon a sequence of changepoint times and manoeuvre parameters. In this paper, new variable rate models for tracking are presented. Previously, a 2-dimensional model has been developed which parameterises the motion with tangential and normal accelerations. This model is extended by introducing additional variables to improve resilience to model error. It is then modified for use in 3 dimensions by assuming manoeuvres are planar. Simulation tests demonstrate improved tracking performance on a benchmark aeroplane trajectory.},

  Abstract                 = {Covariance estimation for high dimensional signals is a classically difficult problem in statistical signal analysis and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to covariance estimation, which employs a novel non-linear sparsity constraint. More specifically, the covariance is constrained to have an eigen decomposition which can be represented as a sparse matrix transform (SMT). The SMT is formed by a product of pairwise coordinate rotations known as Givens rotations. Using this framework, the covariance can be efficiently estimated using greedy optimization of the log-likelihood function, and the number of Givens rotations can be efficiently computed using a cross-validation procedure. The resulting estimator is generally positive definite and well-conditioned, even when the sample size is limited. Experiments on a combination of simulated data, standard hyperspectral data, and face image sets show that the SMT-based covariance estimates are consistently more accurate than both traditional shrinkage estimates and recently proposed graphical lasso estimates for a variety of different classes and sample sizes. An important property of the new covariance estimate is that it naturally yields a fast implementation of the estimated eigen-transformation using the SMT representation. In fact, the SMT can be viewed as a generalization of the classical fast Fourier transform (FFT) in that it uses butterflies to represent an orthonormal transform. However, unlike the FFT, the SMT can be used for fast eigen-signal analysis of general non-stationary signals.},

A dynamic Gaussian mixture model is utilized for representing the time-varying clustering structure. This involves point process formulations of typical behavioral moves such as birth and death of clusters as well as merging and splitting. Following our previous work, we adopt here two strategies for increasing the sampling efficiency of the basic MCMC scheme: an evolutionary stage which allows improved exploration of the sample space, and an EM-based method for making optimized proposals based on the frame likelihood. The algorithm's performance is assessed and demonstrated in both synthetic and real tracking scenarios.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides a new Bayesian approach for models with multiple change points. The centerpiece of the approach is a formulation of the change-point model in terms of a latent discrete state variable that indicates the regime from which a particular observation has been drawn. This state variable is specified to evolve according to a discrete-time discrete-state Markov process with the transition probabilities constrained so that the state variable can either stay at the current value or jump to the next higher value. This parameterization exactly reproduces the change point model. The model is estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods using an approach that is based on Chib (1996). This methodology is quite valuable since it allows for the fitting of more complex change point models than was possible before. Methods for the computation of Bayes factors are also developed.

  Abstract                 = { Abstract We provide a detailed, introductory exposition of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a powerful Markov chain method to simulate multivariate distributions. A simple, intuitive derivation of this method is given along with guidance on implementation. Also discussed are two applications of the algorithm, one for implementing acceptance-rejection sampling when a blanketing function is not available and the other for implementing the algorithm with block-at-a-time scans. In the latter situation, many different algorithms, including the Gibbs sampler, are shown to be special cases of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The methods are illustrated with examples. },

  Abstract                 = {Forecasting the returns of assets at high frequency is the key challenge for high frequency algorithmic trading strategies. In this paper we propose a jump-diffusion model for asset price movements that models price and its trend and allows a momentum strategy to be developed. Conditional on jump times, we derive closed-form transition densities for this model. We show how this allows us to extract a trend from high frequency finance data by using a Rao-Blackwellized variable rate particle filter to filter incoming price data. Our results show that even in the presence of transaction costs our algorithm can achieve a Sharpe ratio above 1 when applied across a portfolio of 75 futures contracts at high frequency.},

The main characteristics of these algorithms are discussed and a convergence result for the entire class is stated.},

Except for a restricted class of models, the optimal filter does not admit a closed-form expression. Particle filtering methods are a set of flexible and powerful sequential Monte Carlo methods designed to. solve the optimal filtering problem numerically. The posterior distribution of the state is approximated by a large set of Dirac-delta masses (samples/particles) that evolve randomly in time according to the dynamics of the model and the observations. The particles are interacting; thus, classical limit theorems relying on statistically independent samples do not apply. In this paper, our aim is to present a survey of convergence results on this class of methods to make them accessible to practitioners},

  Abstract                 = {We derive several new algorithms for particle flow with non-zero diffusion corresponding to Bayes rule. This is unlike all of our previous particle flows, which assumed zero diffusion for the flow corresponding to Bayes rule. We emphasize, however, that all of our particle flows have always assumed non-zero diffusion for the dynamical model of the evolution of the state vector in time. Our new algorithm is simple and fast, and it has an especially nice intuitive formula, which is the same as Newtons method to solve the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem (but for each particle rather than only the MLE), and it is also the same as the extended Kalman filter for the special case of Gaussian densities (but for each particle rather than just the point estimate). All of these new flows apply to arbitrary multimodal densities with smooth nowhere vanishing non-Gaussian densities.},

The filter is exact, and it can be implemented in real-time with a computational complexity that is comparable to the Kalman filter. This new filter includes both the Kalman filter and the discrete time version of the BeneÂ¿ filter as special cases. Moreover, the new theory can handle a large class of nonlinear estimation problems that cannot be solved using the Kalman or discrete time BeneÂ¿ filters. A new approximation technique is suggested for problems that do not satisfy the theoretical conditions exactly. This approximation is simple and straightforward, analogous to the extended Kalman filter.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a principled algorithm for robust Bayesian filtering and smoothing in nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems when both the transition function and the measurement function are described by non-parametric Gaussian process (GP) models. GPs are gaining increasing importance in signal processing, machine learning, robotics, and control for representing unknown system functions by posterior probability distributions. This modern way of system identification is more robust than finding point estimates of a parametric function representation. Our principled filtering/smoothing approach for GP dynamic systems is based on analytic moment matching in the context of the forward-backward algorithm. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach in situations where other state-of-the-art Gaussian filters and smoothers can fail.},

  Abstract                 = {The main challenge in articulated body motion tracking is the large number of degrees of freedom (around 30) to be recovered. Search algorithms, either deterministic or stochastic, that search such a space without constraint, fall foul of exponential computational complexity. One approach is to introduce constraints: either labelling using markers or colour coding, prior assumptions about motion trajectories or view restrictions. Another is to relax constraints arising from articulation, and track limbs as if their motions were independent. In contrast, we aim for general tracking without special preparation of objects or restrictive assumptions. The principal contribution of the paper is the development of a modified particle filter for search in high dimensional configuration spaces. It uses a continuation principle based on annealing to introduce the influence of narrow peaks in the fitness function, gradually. The new algorithm, termed annealed particle filtering, is shown to be capable of recovering full articulated body motion efficiently},

The data augmentation method is shown to converge geometrically, since a duality principle transfers properties from the discrete missing data chain to the parameters. The fully conditional Gibbs alternative is shown to be ergodic and geometric convergence is established in the normal case. We also consider non-informative approximations associated with improper priors, assuming that the sample corresponds exactly to a k-component mixture.},

The algorithm is used for training the parameters of a dynamical system model that is proposed for better representing the spectral dynamics of speech for recognition. It is assumed that the observed feature vectors of a phone segment are the output of a stochastic linear dynamical system, and it is shown how the evolution of the dynamics as a function of the segment length can be modeled using alternative assumptions. A phoneme classification task using the TIMIT database demonstrates that the approach is the first effective use of an explicit model for statistical dependence between frames of speech},

The filters propagate a particle set over time to track the system state, but, in contrast to conventional particle filters, there is no proposal density or importance sampling involved. Particles are smoothly migrated using a particle flow derived from a log-homotopy relating the prior and the posterior. Impressive performance has been demonstrated for a wide range of systems, but the implemented algorithms rely on an extended/unscented Kalman filter (EKF/UKF) that is executed in parallel. We illustrate through simulation that the performance of the exact flow DH filter can be compromised when the UKF and EKF fail. By introducing simple but important modifications to the exact flow DH filter implementation, the performance can be improved dramatically.},

Given a set of observations, our aim is to estimate the states of the finite state Markov chain and the continuous (in space) states of the linear system. In this paper, we present original deterministic and stochastic iterative algorithms for optimal state estimation of JMLSs. The first stochastic algorithm yields minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimates of the finite state space Markov chain and of the continuous state of the JMLS. A deterministic and a stochastic algorithm are given to obtain the marginal maximum a posteriori (MMAP) sequence estimate of the finite state Markov chain. Finally, a deterministic and a stochastic algorithm are derived to obtain the MMAP sequence estimate of the continuous state of the JMLS. Computer simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The problem of deconvolution of Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) processes and the problem of tracking a maneuvering target are addressed},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we present an overview of methods for sequential simulation from posterior distributions. These methods are of particular interest in Bayesian filtering for discrete time dynamic models that are typically nonlinear and non-Gaussian. A general importance sampling framework is developed that unifies many of the methods which have been proposed over the last few decades in several different scientific disciplines. Novel extensions to the existing methods are also proposed. We show in particular how to incorporate local linearisation methods similar to those which have previously been employed in the deterministic filtering literature; these lead to very effective importance distributions. Furthermore we describe a method which uses Rao-Blackwellisation in order to take advantage of the analytic structure present in some important classes of state-space models. In a final section we develop algorithms for prediction, smoothing and evaluation of the likelihood in dynamic models.},

In this paper, our aim is to recursively compute optimal state estimates for this class of systems. We present efficient simulation-based algorithms called particle filters to solve the optimal filtering problem as well as the optimal fixed-lag smoothing problem. Our algorithms combine sequential importance sampling, a selection scheme, and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. They use several variance reduction methods to make the most of the statistical structure of JMLS. Computer simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The problems of on-line deconvolution of impulsive processes and of tracking a maneuvering target are considered. It is shown that our algorithms outperform the current methods},

  Abstract                 = { Ever-increasing computational power, along with evermore sophisticated statistical computing techniques, is making it possible to fit evermore complex statistical models. Among the more computationally intensive methods, the Gibbs sampler is popular because of its simplicity and power to effectively generate samples from a high-dimensional probability distribution. Despite its simple implementation and description, however, the Gibbs sampler is criticized for its sometimes slow convergence, especially when it is used to fit highly structured complex models. Here we present partially collapsed Gibbs sampling strategies that improve the convergence by capitalizing on a set of functionally incompatible conditional distributions. Such incompatibility generally is avoided in the construction of a Gibbs sampler, because the resulting convergence properties are not well understood. We introduce three basic tools (marginalization, permutation, and trimming) that allow us to transform a Gibbs sampler into a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler with known stationary distribution and faster convergence. },

  Abstract                 = {We consider regression models where the underlying functional relationship between the response and the explanatory variable is modeled as independent linear regressions on disjoint segments. We present an algorithm for perfect simulation from the posterior distribution of such a model, even allowing for an unknown number of segments and an unknown model order for the linear regressions within each segment. The algorithm is simple, can scale well to large data sets, and avoids the problem of diagnosing convergence that is present with Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approaches to this problem. We demonstrate our algorithm on standard denoising problems, on a piecewise constant AR model, and on a speech segmentation problem.},

  Abstract                 = { This article considers how to implement Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) moves within a particle filter. Previous, similar, attempts have required the complete history (trajectory) of each particle to be stored. Here, it is shown how certain MCMC moves can be introduced within a particle filter when only summaries of each particles' trajectory are stored. These summaries are based on sufficient statistics. Using this idea, the storage requirement of the particle filter can be substantially reduced, and MCMC moves can be implemented more efficiently. We illustrate how this idea can be used for both the bearingsonly tracking problem and a model of stochastic volatility. We give a detailed comparison of the performance of different particle filters for the bearings-only tracking problem. MCMC, combined with a sensible initialization of the filter and stratified resampling, produces substantial gains in the efficiency of the particle filter. },

This algorithm enables simulation from the true joint posterior distribution of the number and position of the changepoints for a class of changepoint models. The computational cost of this exact algorithm is quadratic in the number of observations. We further show how resampling ideas from particle filters can be used to reduce the computational cost to linear in the number of observations, at the expense of introducing small errors, and we propose two new, optimum resampling algorithms for this problem. One, a version of rejection control, allows the particle filter to choose the number of particles that are required at each time step automatically. The new resampling algorithms substantially outperform standard resampling algorithms on examples that we consider; and we demonstrate how the resulting particle filter is practicable for segmentation of human G+C content.},

Through simulation studies we show that substantial gains in efficiency are obtained for practical amounts of computational cost. It is shown both through these simulation studies, and by the analysis of an athletics dataset, that our new method also substantially outperforms the simple filter-smoother, the only other smoother with computational cost that is O(N).},

By exploiting the statistical structure of the model, we develop a Rao-Blackwellized particle smoother. Due to the lengthy nature of real signals, we suggest processing the data in blocks, and a block-based smoother algorithm is developed for this purpose. All the algorithms suggested are tested with real speech and audio data, and the results are shown and compared with those generated using the generic particle smoother and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). It is found that the proposed Rao-Blackwellized particle smoother improves on the standard particle smoother and the extended Kalman smoother. In addition, the proposed block-based smoother algorithm enhances the efficiency of the proposed Rao-Blackwellized smoother by significantly reducing the storage capacity required for the particle information},

The least squares prediction problem is defined for the given data case, and it is shown that many of the currently used lattice methods are actually approximations to the stationary least squares solution. The recently developed class of adaptive least squares lattice algorithms are described in detail, both in their unnormalized and normalized forms. The performance of the adaptive least squares lattice algorithm is compared to that of some gradient adaptive methods. Lattice forms for ARMA processes, for joint process estimation, and for the sliding-window covariance case are presented. The use of lattice structures for efficient factorization of covariance matrices and solution of Toeplitz sets of equations is briefly discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Computing (ratios of) normalizing constants of probability models is a fundamental computational problem for many statistical and scientific studies. Monte Carlo simulation is an effective technique, especially with complex and high-dimensional models. This paper aims to bring to the attention of general statistical audiences of some effective methods originating from theoretical physics and at the same time to explore these methods from a more statistical perspective, through establishing theoretical connections and illustrating their uses with statistical problems. We show that the acceptance ratio method and thermodynamic integration are natural generalizations of importance sampling, which is most familiar to statistical audiences. The former generalizes importance sampling through the use of a single "bridge" density and is thus a case of bridge sampling in the sense of Meng and Wong. Thermodynamic integration, which is also known in the numerical analysis literature as Ogata's method for high-dimensional integration, corresponds to the use of infinitely many and continuously connected bridges (and thus a "path"). Our path sampling formulation offers more flexibility and thus potential efficiency to thermodynamic integration, and the search of optimal paths turns out to have close connections with the Jeffreys prior density and the Rao and Hellinger distances between two densities. We provide an informative theoretical example as well as two empirical examples (involving 17- to 70-dimensional integrations) to illustrate the potential and implementation of path sampling. We also discuss some open problems.},

Such models are used to model interventions in time series and nonparametric regression. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is usually necessary to obtain the posterior distributions of such mixture models, because it is difficult to obtain them analytically. The methodological contribution of the article is to derive a set of recursions for dynamic mixture models that efficiently implement a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme that converges rapidly to the posterior distribution. The methodology is illustrated by fitting an autoregressive model subject to interventions to zinc concentration in sludge.},

Conditions under which the numerical approximation of a posterior moment converges almost surely to the true value as the number of Monte Carlo replications increases, and the numerical accuracy of this approximation may be assessed reliably, are set forth. Methods for the analytical verification of these conditions are discussed. Importance sampling densities are derived from multivariate normal of Student t approximations to local behavior of the posterior density at its mode. These densities are modified by automatic rescaling along each axis. The concept of relative numerical efficiency is introduced to evaluate the adequacy of a chosen importance sampling density. The practical procedures based on these innovations are illustrated in two different models.},

  Abstract                 = {Local convergence is a limitation of many optimization approaches for multimodal functions. For hybrid model learning, this can mean a compromise in accuracy. We develop an approach for learning the model parameters of hybrid discrete-continuous systems that avoids getting stuck in locally optimal solutions. We present an algorithm that implements this approach that 1) iteratively learns the locations and shapes of explored local maxima of the likelihood function, and 2) focuses the search away from these areas of the solution space, toward undiscovered maxima that are a priori likely to be optimal solutions. We evaluate the algorithm on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) data. Our aggregate results show reduction in distance to the global maximum by 16% in 10 iterations, averaged over 100 trials, and iterative increase in log-likelihood value of learned model parameters, demonstrating the ability of the algorithm to guide the search toward increasingly better optima of the likelihood function, avoiding local convergence.},

The particle-filter [6] based algorithm combines the benefits of variable-rate filtering [5] with a variable-dimension, manoeuvre-based representation of the target trajectory. Variable-rate filtering allows the algorithm to model manoeuvre changes at arbitrary (non-measurement) times, while manoeuvre-based modelling adds to track robustness by providing a parsimonious representation of the target trajectory. The efficiency of the particle filter has been greatly enhanced using reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo [7] moves that are applied in a Resample-Move fashion [4]. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on some example representative scenarios:},

However, MCMC sampling is too slow to be of practical use in problems involving a large number of posterior (target) distributions, as in dynamic modelling and predictive model selection. Alternative simulation techniques for tracking moving target distributions, known as particle filters, which combine importance sampling, importance resampling and MCMC sampling, tend to suffer from a progressive degeneration as the target sequence evolves. We propose a new technique, based on these same simulation methodologies, which does not suffer from this progressive degeneration.},

Many popular nonlinear time series models, including threshold, smooth transition and Markov-switching models, can be written in state-space form. It is then straightforward to add components that capture parameter instability and intervention effects. We advocate a Bayesian approach to estimation and inference, using an efficient implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes for such linear dynamic mixture models. The general modelling framework and the Bayesian methodology are illustrated by means of several examples. An application to quarterly industrial production growth rates for the \{G7\} countries demonstrates the empirical usefulness of the approach.},

The methods rely on a particle cloud representation of the filtering distribution which evolves through time using importance sampling and resampling ideas. MAP sequence estimation is then performed using a classical dynamic programming technique applied to the discretised version of the state space. In contrast with standard approaches to the problem which essentially compare only the trajectories generated directly during the filtering stage, our method efficiently computes the optimal trajectory over all combinations of the filtered states. A particular strength of the method is that MAP sequence estimation is performed sequentially in one single forwards pass through the data without the requirement of an additional backward sweep. An application to estimation of a non-linear time series model and to spectral estimation for time-varying autoregressions is described.},

  Abstract                 = {Here we describe recent advances in particle filtering algorithms and models for tracking of manoeuvring objects in clutter. The methods develop on the basic variable dimension particle filtering algorithms introduced in S.J. Godsill and J. Vermaak (2004), in which a new type of dynamical model is introduced whose state variables arrive at unknown times relative to the observation process (hence 'variable rate'). Targets are assumed to follow deterministic trajectories in between state times, determined by an appropriate model, such as the differential equation model for the object. The framework allows for automatic modelling and estimation of the trajectories of targets using an adaptation of particle filtering methods (A. Doucet et al., 2000) into the variable dimension setting. In this paper we introduce more effective sampling schemes for the variable rate setting that ensure future states are only generated as and when required, new dynamical models appropriate for manoeuvring objects, and new observation models under the assumption of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process for both targets and clutter. Simulations show very effective tracking performance under challenging settings which cannot be emulated in a standard fixed rate scheme},

The methods rely on a particle representation of the filtering distributions, and their evolution through time using sequential importance sampling and resampling ideas. In particular, novel techniques are presented for generation of sample realizations of historical state sequences. This is carried out in a forward-filtering backward-smoothing procedure that can be viewed as the nonlinear, non-Gaussian counterpart of standard Kalman filter-based simulation smoothers in the linear Gaussian case. Convergence in the mean squared error sense of the smoothed trajectories is proved, showing the validity of our proposed method. The methods are tested in a substantial application for the processing of speech signals represented by a time-varying autoregression and parameterized in terms of time-varying partial correlation coefficients, comparing the results of our algorithm with those from a simple smoother based on the filtered trajectories. },

The method is applied to the estimation of parameters in a simple stochastic volatility model (SV) of the U.S. short-term interest rate. We also provide a simulation study to validate our method, using synthetic data generated by the SV model with parameters calibrated to match weekly observations of the U.S. short-term interest rate.},

Such models are often stochastic and analytically intractable, containing uncertain parameters that must be estimated from time course data. In this article, we consider the task of inferring the parameters of a stochastic kinetic model defined as a Markov (jump) process. Inference for the parameters of complex nonlinear multivariate stochastic process models is a challenging problem, but we find here that algorithms based on particle Markov chain Monte Carlo turn out to be a very effective computationally intensive approach to the problem. Approximations to the inferential model based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are considered, as well as improvements to the inference scheme that exploit the SDE structure. We apply the methodology to a LotkaVolterra system and a prokaryotic auto-regulatory network.},

  Abstract                 = {In a MetropolisHastings algorithm, rejection of proposed moves is an intrinsic part of ensuring that the chain converges to the intended target distribution. However, persistent rejection, perhaps in particular parts of the state space, may indicate that locally the proposal distribution is badly calibrated to the target. As an alternative to careful off-line tuning of state-dependent proposals, the basic algorithm can be modified so that, on rejection, a second attempt to move is made. A different proposal can be generated from a new distribution that is allowed to depend on the previously rejected proposal. We generalise this idea of delaying the rejection and adapting the proposal distribution, due to Tierney & Mira (1999), to generate a more flexible class of methods that applies in particular to a variable-dimension setting. The approach is illustrated by two pedagogical examples and a more realistic application to a changepoints analysis for point processes.},

  Abstract                 = {A framework for positioning, navigation, and tracking problems using particle filters (sequential Monte Carlo methods) is developed. It consists of a class of motion models and a general nonlinear measurement equation in position. A general algorithm is presented, which is parsimonious with the particle dimension. It is based on marginalization, enabling a Kalman filter to estimate all position derivatives, and the particle filter becomes low dimensional. This is of utmost importance for high-performance real-time applications. Automotive and airborne applications illustrate numerically the advantage over classical Kalman filter-based algorithms. Here, the use of nonlinear models and non-Gaussian noise is the main explanation for the improvement in accuracy. More specifically, we describe how the technique of map matching is used to match an aircraft's elevation profile to a digital elevation map and a car's horizontal driven path to a street map. In both cases, real-time implementations are available, and tests have shown that the accuracy in both cases is comparable with satellite navigation (as GPS) but with higher integrity. Based on simulations, we also argue how the particle filter can be used for positioning based on cellular phone measurements, for integrated navigation in aircraft, and for target tracking in aircraft and cars. Finally, the particle filter enables a promising solution to the combined task of navigation and tracking, with possible application to airborne hunting and collision avoidance systems in cars},

Typically the subsequent off-line data processing is carried out using a combination of heuristic methods with little mathematical rigour. We present a novel model which is able to accurately predict the effect of the many biological processes which are involved, and moreover, which is usable on-line. Off-line methods have been hampered by the need for processing in as little time as possible after the data is generated; performing the processing on-line has enabled a more advanced algorithm to be used with associated improved performance. The algorithm is framed within a Bayesian probabilistic framework, thereby allowing representation of the random nature of the generative process, and relies on new advances in the burgeoning field of sequential Monte Carlo methods to perform non-linear filtering and model selection operations},

  Abstract                 = {In filtering algorithms, it is often desirable that the prior and posterior densities share a common density parameterization. This can rarely be done exactly. Instead it is necessary to seek a density from the same family as the prior which closely approximates the true posterior. We extend a method for computing the optimal parameter values for representing the posterior within a given parameterization. This is achieved by minimizing the deviation between the parameterized density and a homotopy that deforms the prior density into the posterior density. We derive novel results both for the general case, and for specific choices of measures of deviation. This includes approximate solution methods, that prove useful when we demonstrate how the method can be used with common density parameterizations. For an example with a non-linear measurement model, the method is shown to be more accurate than the Extended, Unscented and Cubature Kalman filters.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a very tractable approach to modeling changes in regime. The parameters of an autoregression are viewed as the outcome of a discrete-state Markov process. For example, the mean growth rate of a nonstationary series may be subject to occasional, discrete shifts. The econometrician is presumed not to observe these shifts directly, but instead must draw probabilistic inference about whether and when they may have occurred based on the observed behavior of the series. The paper presents an algorithm for drawing such estimation of population parameters by the method of maximum likelihood and provides the foundation for forecasting future values of the series. An empirical application of this technique to postwar U.S. real GNP suggests that the periodic shift from a positive growth rate to a negative growth rate is a recurrent feature of the U.S. business cycle, and indeed could be used as an objective criterion for defining and measuring economic recessions. The estimated parameter values suggest that a typical economic recession is associated with a 3% permanent drop in the level of GNP.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper is concerned with recursively estimating the internal state sequence of a discrete-time dynamic system by processing a sequence of noisy measurements taken from the system output. Recursive processing requires some kind of sufficient statistic for representing the information collected up to a certain time step. For this purpose, the probability density functions of the state are especially well suited. Once they are available, almost any type of point estimate, e.g. mean, mode, or median, can be derived. In the case of continuous states, however, the exact probability density functions characterizing the state estimate are in general either not feasible or not well suited for recursive processing. Hence, approximations of the true densities are generally inevitable, where Gaussian mixture approximations are convenient for a number of reasons. However, calculating appropriate mixture parameters that minimize a global measure of deviation from the true density is a tough optimization task. Here, we propose a new approximation method that minimizes the squared integral deviation between the true density and its mixture approximation. Rather than trying to solve the original problem, it is converted into a corresponding system of explicit ordinary first-order differential equations. This system of differential equations is then solved over a finite "time" interval, which is an efficient way of calculating the desired optimal parameter values. We focus on the measurement update in the important case of vector states and scalar measurements. In addition, approximation densities with separable kernels are assumed. It will be shown, that if the measurement nonlinearities are also separable, the required multidimensional integrals can be reduced to the product of one-dimensional integrals. For several important types of measurement functions including polynomial measurement nonlinearities, closed-form analytic expressions for the coefficients of the system of differential equations are available.},

The purpose of the paper is to show that the Bayesian approach provides; 1) a general unifying framework within which to pursue further researches in stochastic estimation and control problems, and 2) the necessary computations and difficulties that must be overcome for these problems. An example of a nonlinear, non-Gaussian estimation problem is also solved.},

  Abstract                 = {The basic nonlinear filtering problem for dynamical systems is considered. Approximating the optimal filter estimate by particle filter methods has become perhaps the most common and useful method in recent years. Many variants of particle filters have been suggested, and there is an extensive literature on the theoretical aspects of the quality of the approximation. Still a clear-cut result that the approximate solution, for unbounded functions, converges to the true optimal estimate as the number of particles tends to infinity seems to be lacking. It is the purpose of this contribution to give such a basic convergence result for a rather general class of unbounded functions. Furthermore, a general framework, including many of the particle filter algorithms as special cases, is given.},

Under certain standard conditions, each fitted submodel is itself a local least squares solution, and the overall least squares solution can be found quite easily. The exceptions to this rule are studied. The easiest case to handle occurs when a join point** coincides with an abscissa of the given data. In that case it is possible to modify local least squares estimates so that they satisfy an obvious linear constraint (the requirement that the curves do actually join there). If the model is not made up entirely of a mixture of straight lines and constants, we will deal separately with the case where the submodels join together with equal slopes. The solution then requires iterative techniques. },

We consider stochastic dynamic systems detected by observation processes. The difficulty lies in the fact that the estimation of the states requires the assignment of the observations to the multiple targets. We propose an extension of the classical particle filter where the stochastic vector of assignment is estimated by a Gibbs sampler. This algorithm is used to estimate the trajectories of multiple targets from their noisy bearings, thus showing its ability to solve the data association problem. Moreover this algorithm is easily extended to multireceiver observations where the receivers can produce measurements of various nature with different frequencies.},

  Abstract                 = {The application of particle filters to real-time systems is often limited because of their computational complexity, and hence the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) that contain hundreds of processing elements on a chip is very promising. However, parallel implementations of particle filters with state-of-the-art systematic resampling on a GPU suffer from a severe workload imbalance problem, which results in fluctuation of the computation speed and hinders their application to real-time systems. We analyze the computational load imbalance of the systematic resampling method in conventional implementations, and show that the workload imbalance is proportional to the variance of weights in particle filters. Then, we propose a load balanced particle replication (LBPR) algorithm for systematic resampling, which shows almost constant execution speed and outperforms the conventional algorithm in terms of the worst-case computation time. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on an NVIDIA GTX580 GPU.},

We present the systematic formulation of Gaussian filters and develop efficient and accurate numerical integration of the optimal filter. We also discuss the mixed Gaussian filters in which the conditional probability density is approximated by the sum of Gaussian distributions. A new update rule of weights for Gaussian sum filters is proposed. Our numerical tests demonstrate that new filters significantly improve the extended Kalman filter with no additional cost, and the new Gaussian sum filter has a nearly optimal performance},

Although the filtering problem has received little attention, it is useful for estimating latent states, forecasting volatility and returns, computing model diagnostics such as likelihood ratios, and parameter estimation. Our approach combines time-discretization schemes with Monte Carlo methods. It is quite general, applying in nonlinear and multivariate jump-diffusion models and models with nonanalytic observation equations. We provide a detailed analysis of the filter's performance, and analyze four applications: disentangling jumps from stochastic volatility, forecasting volatility, comparing models via likelihood ratios, and filtering using option prices and returns.},

The UT is a method for predicting means and covariances in nonlinear systems. A set of samples are deterministically chosen which match the mean and covariance of a (not necessarily Gaussian-distributed) probability distribution. These samples can be scaled by an arbitrary constant. The method guarantees that the mean and covariance second order accuracy in mean and covariance, giving the same performance as a second order truncated filter but without the need to calculate any Jacobians or Hessians. The impacts of scaling issues are illustrated by considering conversions from polar to Cartesian coordinates with large angular uncertainties.},

  Abstract                 = {The Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearizes all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterize mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalizes elegantly to nonlinear systems without the linearization steps required by the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the EKF in virtually all applications.},

(2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co- efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are ob- tained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

  Abstract                 = { We develop a methodology to efficiently implement the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) algorithms of Green, applicable for example to model selection inference in a Bayesian framework, which builds on the dragging fast variables ideas of Neal. We call such algorithms annealed importance sampling reversible jump (aisRJ). The proposed procedures can be thought of as being exact approximations of idealized RJ algorithms which in a model selection problem would sample the model labels only, but cannot be implemented. Central to the methodology is the idea of bridging different models with fictitious intermediate models, whose role is to introduce smooth intermodel transitions and, as we shall see, improve performance. Efficiency of the resulting algorithms is demonstrated on two standard model selection problems and we show that despite the additional computational effort incurred, the approach can be highly competitive computationally.

  Abstract                 = { The data association problem occurs in multiple target tracking applications. Since nonlinear and non-Gaussian estimation problems are solved approximately in an optimal way using recursive Monte Carlo methods or particle filters, the association step is crucial for the overall performance. We introduce a Bayesian data association method based on the particle filter idea and joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) hypothesis calculations. A comparison with classical EKF based data association methods such as the nearest neighbor (NN) method and the JPDA method is made. The NN association method is also applied to the particle filter method. Multiple target tracking using particle filtering increases the computational burden, therefore a control structure for the number of samples needed is proposed. A radar target tracking application is used in a simulation study for evaluation.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, Hamilton's (1988, 1989) Markov-switching model is extended to a general state-space model. This paper also complements Shumway and Stoffer's (1991) dynamic linear models with switching, by introducing dependence in the switching process, and by allowing switching in both measurement and transition equations. Building upon ideas in Hamilton (1989), Cosslett and Lee (1985), and Harrison and Stevens (1976), a basic filtering and smoothing algorithm is presented. The algorithm and the maximum likelihood estimation procedure is applied in estimating Lam's (1990) generalized Hamilton model with a general autoregressive component. The estimation results show that the approximation employed in this paper performs an excellent job, with a considerable advantage in computation time. A statespace representation is a very flexible form, and the approach taken in this paper therefore allows a broad class of models to be estimated that could not be handled before. In addition, the algorithm for calculating smoothed inferences on the unobserved states is a vastly more efficient one than that in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {A non-Gaussian state-space approach to the modeling of nonstationary time series is shown. The model is expressed in state-space form, where the system noise and the observational noise are not necessarily Gaussian. Recursive formulas of prediction, filtering, and smoothing for the state estimation and identification of the non-Gaussian state-space model are given. Also given is a numerical method based on piecewise linear approximation to the density functions for realizing these formulas. Significant merits of non-Gaussian modeling and the wide range of applicability of the method are illustrated by some numerical examples. A typical application of this non-Gaussian modeling is the smoothing of a time series that has mean value function with both abrupt and gradual changes. Simple Gaussian state-space modeling is not adequate for this situation. Here the model with small system noise variance cannot detect jump, whereas the one with large system noise variance yields unfavorable wiggle. To work out this problem within the ordinary linear Gaussian model framework, sophisticated treatment of outliers is required. But by the use of an appropriate non-Gaussian model for system noise, it is possible to reproduce both abrupt and gradual change of the mean without any special treatment. Nonstandard observations such as the ones distributed as non-Gaussian distribution can be easily treated by the direct modeling of an observational scheme. Smoothing of a transformed series such as a log periodogram can be treated by this method. Outliers in the observations can be treated as well by using heavy-tailed distribution for observational noise density. The algorithms herein can be easily extended to a wider class of models. As an example, the smoothing of nonhomogeneous binomial mean function is shown, where the observation is distributed according to a discrete random variable. Extension to a nonlinear system is also straightforward.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the problem of modeling maneuvering target motion in tracking applications. Moving targets typically follow deterministic straight-line or curved trajectories, with minor deviations due to random disturbances. As a result, modeling target motion typically involves the derivation of state transition functions based on the laws of kinematics, with the addition of uncertainty terms in the form of random noise to compensate for model mismatch. Although it is possible to construct quite accurate models, there is a trade-off between model simplicity (and, thus, ease of implementation) and model accuracy. In this paper, we present a model for target motion that is based on a Brownian description of the target's speed and heading, which allows the derivation of closed form expressions for the exact first two moments of the propagated probability density function of the target's state vector. We outline the design of tracking algorithms based on this model, and demonstrate its effectiveness in dealing with maneuvering targets based on simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple method for subset selection of independent variables in regression models is proposed. We expand the usual regression equation to an equation that incorporates all possible subsets of predictors by adding indicator variables as parameters. The vector of indicator variables dictates which predictors to include. Several choices of priors can be employed for the unknown regression coefficients and the unknown indicator parameters. The posterior distribution of the indicator vector is approximated by means of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We select subsets with high posterior probabilities. In addition to linear models, we consider generalized linear models.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Almost all research fields in geosciences use numerical models and observations and combine these using data-assimilation techniques. With ever-increasing resolution and complexity, the numerical models tend to be highly nonlinear and also observations become more complicated and their relation to the models more nonlinear. Standard data-assimilation techniques like (ensemble) Kalman filters and variational methods like 4D-Var rely on linearizations and are likely to fail in one way or another. Nonlinear data-assimilation techniques are available, but are only efficient for small-dimensional problems, hampered by the so-called curse of dimensionality. Here we present a fully nonlinear particle filter that can be applied to higher dimensional problems by exploiting the freedom of the proposal density inherent in particle filtering. The method is illustrated for the three-dimensional Lorenz model using three particles and the much more complex 40-dimensional Lorenz model using 20 particles. By also applying the method to the 1000-dimensional Lorenz model, again using only 20 particles, we demonstrate the strong scale-invariance of the method, leading to the optimistic conjecture that the method is applicable to realistic geophysical problems.

This class of distributions is related to the Cayley transform that maps a p ( p - 1 ) / 2 × 1 vector s into \{SO\} ( p ) , the space of p × p rotation matrices. First an expression for the uniform measure on \{SO\} ( p ) is derived using the Cayley transform, then the Cayley density for random rotations is investigated. A closed-form expression is derived for its normalizing constant, a simple simulation algorithm is proposed, and moments are derived. The efficiencies of moment estimators of the parameters of the new model are also calculated. A Monte Carlo investigation of tests and of confidence regions for the parameters of the new density is briefly summarized. A numerical example is presented. },

  Abstract                 = {The particle Gibbs (PG) sampler was introduced in [1] as a way to incorporate a particle filter (PF) in a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. The resulting method was shown to be an efficient tool for joint Bayesian parameter and state inference in nonlinear, non-Gaussian state-space models. However, the mixing of the PG kernel can be very poor when there is severe degeneracy in the PF. Hence, the success of the PG sampler heavily relies on the, often unrealistic, assumption that we can implement a PF without suffering from any considerate degeneracy. However, as pointed out by Whiteley [2] in the discussion following [1], the mixing can be improved by adding a backward simulation step to the PG sampler. Here, we investigate this further, derive an explicit PG sampler with backward simulation (denoted PG-BSi) and show that this indeed is a valid MCMC method. Furthermore, we show in a numerical example that backward simulation can lead to a considerable increase in performance over the standard PG sampler.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract This article describes a method of grouping and collapsing in using the Gibbs sampler and proves from an operator theory viewpoint that the method is in general beneficial. The norms of the forward operators associated with the corresponding nonreversible Markov chains are used to discriminate among different simulation schemes. When applied to Bayesian missing data problems, the idea of collapsing suggests skipping the steps of sampling parameter(s) values in standard data augmentation. By doing this, we obtain a predictive update version of the Gibbs sampler. A procedure of calculating the posterior odds ratio via the collapsed Gibbs sampler when incomplete observations are involved is presented. As an illustration of possible applications, three examples, along with a Bayesian treatment for identifying common protein binding sites in unaligned DNA sequences, are provided. },

Under this framework, several currently available techniques are studied and generalized to accommodate more complex features. All of these methods are partial combinations of three ingredients: importance sampling and resampling, rejection sampling, and Markov chain iterations. We provide guidelines on how they should be used and under what circumstance each method is most suitable. Through the analysis of differences and connections, we consolidate these methods into a generic algorithm by combining desirable features. In addition, we propose a general use of Rao-Blackwellization to improve performance. Examples from econometrics and engineering are presented to demonstrate the importance of RaoBlackwellization and to compare different Monte Carlo procedures. },

A rejuvenation procedure for improving the efficiency of sequential imputation is introduced and theoretically justified. The proposed method does not require the channel to be nonminimum phase and can be used in real time signal restoration. Two simulated systems are studied to illustrate the proposed method. Our result shows that the ideas of multiple imputations and flexible simulation techniques are as powerful in engineering as in survey sampling.},

In dynamic weighting Monte Carlo, one augments the original state space of interest by a weighting factor, which allows the resulting Markov chain to move more freely and to escape from local modes. It uses a new invariance principle to guide the construction of transition rules. We analyze the behavior of the weights resulting from such a process and provide detailed recommendations on how to use these weights properly. Our recommendations are supported by a renewal theory-type analysis. Our theoretical investigations are further demonstrated by a simulation study and applications in neural network training and Ising model simulations. },

  Abstract                 = { Bayesian methods provide a rigorous general framework for dynamic state estimation problems. We describe the nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problem and its optimal Bayesian solution. Since the optimal solution is intractable, several different approximation strategies are then described. These approaches include the extended Kalman filter and particle filters. For a particular problem, if the assumptions of the Kalman filter hold, then no other algorithm can out-perform it. However, in a variety of real scenarios, the assumptions do not hold and approximate techniques must be employed. The extended Kalman filter approximates the models used for the dynamics and measurement process, in order to be able to approximate the probability density by a Gaussian. Particle filtering approximates the density directly as a finite number of samples. A number of different types of particle filter exist and some have been shown to outperform others when used for particular applications. However, when designing a particle filter for a particular application, it is the choice of importance density that is critical. These notes are of a tutorial nature and so, to facilitate easy implementation, 'pseudo-code' for algorithms are included at relevant points.},

  Abstract                 = {The assumption of Gaussian noise in the system and measurement model has been standard practice for target tracking algorithm development for many years. For problems involving manoeuvring targets this is known to be an over-simplification and a potentially poor approximation. In this paper the use of heavy-tailed distributions is suggested as a means of efficiently modelling the behaviour of manoeuvring targets with a single dynamic model. We exploit the fact that all heavy-tailed distributions can be written as scale mixture of Normals to propose a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (SMNPF) where particles sample the history of the continuous scale parameter and a Kalman filter is used to conduct the associated filtering for each particle. Schemes are proposed for making the proposal of new particles efficient. Performance of a heavy-tailed system model implemented via the SMNPF filter is compared against an IMM for a sample trajectory taken from a benchmark problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle filters are an increasingly popular algorithm for tracking in non-linear and non-Gaussian scenarios. However, in scenarios involving multiple pronounced and persistent modes, particle filters can struggle to maintain accurate estimates of the weights associated with these modes. Indeed, particle filters often lose modes all together. We explain why this phenomenon occurs. We articulate some convergence results for particle filters in a context that aims to be accessible to engineering practitioners. We use this review of convergence results to argue the utility of optimised proposal distributions in multi-modal scenarios. We demonstrate the validity of this argument by applying particle filters to synthetic data where multi-modal structure is designed to exist but this structure is unknown to the particle filter. We find that optimised particle filters outperform naive particle filter both when the same number of particles is used and when the total computational cost is kept approximately constant: a smaller number of particles with an optimised proposal distribution can out perform a larger number of particles with a naive proposal distribution. Furthermore, the benefits derived from previous work, which explicitly stratifies the particle filter with the intent of improving performance in multi-modal scenarios, is found to be less than the benefits derived from using optimised proposals. We conclude that multi-modality, perhaps surprisingly, does not motivate a different approach to applications of particle filters to other challenging scenarios.},

The main feature of this algorithm is its ability to estimate the state of a dynamic system with several behavior modes which can switch from one to another. In particular, the IMM estimator can be a self-adjusting variable-bandwidth filter, which makes it natural for tracking maneuvering targets. The importance of this approach is that it is the best compromise available currently-between complexity and performance: its computational requirements are nearly linear in the size of the problem (number of models) while its performance is almost the same as that of an algorithm with quadratic complexity. The objective of this work is to survey and put in perspective the existing IMM methods for target tracking problems. Special attention is given to the assumptions underlying each algorithm and its applicability to various situations},

The big dimensionality attributed to the group tracking problem poses a major difficulty to particle filters (PFs). This in turn has motivated researchers to devise many alternatives and variants over the past decade. In this work, we corroborate and extend a single promising direction for alleviating the dimensionality problem. Our derived scheme endows a recently introduced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) PF algorithm with an improved proposal distribution. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using a nonlinear system with up to 40 states.},

  Abstract                 = {Variable rate particle filters have recently emerged as an alternative to multiple model techniques for tracking highly manoeuverable targets. The basic idea of variable rate methods is to apply local fits to segments of the target trajectory of variable length. Both the fit parameters and the length of the segments need to be estimated. Approximately optimal Bayesian estimation of these quantities can be performed using particle filters. In this paper a Rao-Blackwellised variable particle filter is developed which offers significant performance improvements over existing methods for a certain class of models. This is demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulations for a benchmark tracking problem.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new approach to Bayesian inference that entirely avoids Markov chain simulation, by constructing a map that pushes forward the prior measure to the posterior measure. Existence and uniqueness of a suitable measure-preserving map is established by formulating the problem in the context of optimal transport theory. We discuss various means of explicitly parameterizing the map and computing it efficiently through solution of an optimization problem, exploiting gradient information from the forward model when possible. The resulting algorithm overcomes many of the computational bottlenecks associated with Markov chain Monte Carlo. Advantages of a map-based representation of the posterior include analytical expressions for posterior moments and the ability to generate arbitrary numbers of independent posterior samples without additional likelihood evaluations or forward solves. The optimization approach also provides clear convergence criteria for posterior approximation and facilitates model selection through automatic evaluation of the marginal likelihood. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the approach on nonlinear inverse problems of varying dimension, involving the inference of parameters appearing in ordinary and partial differential equations.},

Accurate aircraft maneuver models are however highly desirable, particularly in air defense applications, to achieve accurate tracking and prediction. Through analysis of actual fighter aircraft trajectories and comparison with the Singer maneuver model, particularly in terms of prediction performance, coordinated turn (CT) aircraft maneuver models are presented, compared, and validated. A more general CT model is shown to better model actual trajectories than the classical CT model used in the literature},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present an online approach for frequency tracking of a noisy sinusoid using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, also known as particle filters (PFs). In addition, apart from employing the classical Cartesian formulation model, we also develop two alternative dynamical models, namely, nearly constant frequency (NCF) and Singer, which are adapted from the maneuvering target tracking discipline, to describe the evolution of time-varying frequencies, and investigate their fitness to the frequency tracking application. When compared with conventional techniques whose performance is restricted to linear Gaussian models and/or to slowly varying frequencies, PFs are more flexible to handle situations where these conditions are violated. Extensive evaluations on the proposed new models and PF tracking algorithms are conducted with different sets of frequency inputs and levels of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). According to the computer simulation results, it is found that PFs under all investigated models consistently outperform and are less sensitive to SNR levels than the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Furthermore, the results suggest that while none of the models perfectly fits all types of frequency inputs, NCF model is more suitable for moderately varying frequencies, whereas the Singer is more suitable for rapidly changing frequencies.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present an online approach for joint detection and tracking for multiple targets using variable rate particle filters (VRPFs). Unlike conventional models and particle filters, the proposed method utilises the applied forces (tangential and radial components) to model target motions and does not assume the hidden state to change at the same rate as the observations. In effect not only does the proposed method enable us to model parsimoniously the manoeuvring behaviours of targets with a single dynamical model but it also provides a more efficient framework for recursive estimation of the targets' positions since much fewer states will be estimated. In addition, a target detection/termination module will be integrated in the proposed method in which a track initiation, termination, or maintenance move is randomly executed using Bayesian Monte Carlo methods. To model a more realistic observation environment Poisson process is chosen for all target originating and spurious measurements. Unlike other observation models, the proposed model does not require extensive computation for data association between active targets and observations, prior to target state estimation, as a result. To improve the quality of the particles we adopt a data-dependent importance sampling strategy in which the latest observations are involved when new particles are updated. This enables the target states to be updated as new observations arrive while keeping the number of states sufficiently low to track the manoeuvres of the targets. Computer simulations demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for detecting and tracking multiple highly manoeuverable targets in a hostile environment with high clutter density and low detection probability.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce an extension of switching linear dynamic systems (SLDS) with parameterized duration modeling capabilities. The proposed model allows arbitrary duration models and overcomes the limitation of a geometric distribution induced in standard SLDSs. By incorporating a duration model which reflects the data more closely, the resulting model provides reliable inference results which are robust against observation noise. Moreover, existing inference algorithms for SLDSs can be adopted with only modest additional effort in most cases where an SLDS model can be applied. In addition, we observe the fact that the duration models would vary across data sequences in certain domains, which complicates learning and inference tasks. Such variability in duration is overcome by introducing parameterized duration models. The experimental results on honeybee dance decoding tasks demonstrate the robust inference capabilities of the proposed model.},

  Abstract                 = {Smoothing in state-space models amounts to computing the conditional distribution of the latent state trajectory, given observations, or expectations of functionals of the state trajectory with respect to this distribution. In recent years there has been an increased interest in Monte Carlo-based methods, often involving particle filters, for approximate smoothing in nonlinear and/or non-Gaussian state-space models. One such method is to approximate filter distributions using a particle filter and then to simulate, using backward kernels, a state trajectory backwards on the set of particles. We show that by simulating multiple realizations of the particle filter and adding a Metropolis-Hastings step, one obtains a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme whose stationary distribution is the exact smoothing distribution. This procedure expands upon a similar one recently proposed by Andrieu, Doucet, Holenstein, and Whiteley. We also show that simulating multiple trajectories from each realization of the particle filter can be beneficial from a perspective of variance versus computation time, and illustrate this idea using two examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle methods have been recently proposed to deal with the nonlinear filtering problem. These are Monte Carlo methods that can provide a nonparametric approximation to the signal conditional distribution even in nonlinear and non Gaussian cases, without depending on the state space dimension. We present a new version of regularized particle filter using a progressive correction (PC) principle which improves the approximation, in introducing a decreasing sequence of (fictitious) matrices for the observation noise. This method is applied to the multisensor tracking problem (radar and IR sensor) and compared to the classical regularized particle filter and the EKF.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper describes an identification technique of switching system. The considered system is represented as a weighted sum of local models. To estimate the switching times, a change detection technique is applied. It provides the weights associated to the local models. The Markov parameters of these models are identified by a subspace method. This calculation can yield similar local models which are merged. The procedure of parameter identification an models merging is repeated until convergence. The performance of the approach is investigated on a simulation example.},

The new method leads to faster transmission calculations compared to traditional methods, as well as freedom in choosing alternate Greens function matrix blocks for transmission calculations. The new method also lends itself to calculation of the tridiagonal part of the Greens function matrix. The effect of inaccuracies in the electrode self-energies on the transmission coefficient is analyzed and reveals that the new algorithm is potentially more stable towards such inaccuracies.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary. The paper develops a simulation-based approach to sequential parameter learning and filtering in general state space models. Our approach is based on approximating the target posterior by a mixture of fixed lag smoothing distributions. Parameter inference exploits a sufficient statistic structure and the methodology can be easily implemented by modifying state space smoothing algorithms. We avoid reweighting particles and hence sample degeneracy problems that plague particle filters that use sequential importance sampling. The method is illustrated by using two examples: a benchmark auto-regressive model with observation error and a high dimensional dynamic spatiotemporal model. We show that the method provides accurate inference in the presence of outliers, model misspecification and high dimensionality.},

For this class of models, we present two particle algorithms to compute the score vector and observed information matrix recursively. The first algorithm is implemented with computational complexity and the second with complexity , where N is the number of particles. Although cheaper, the performance of the  method degrades quickly, as it relies on the approximation of a sequence of probability distributions whose dimension increases linearly with time. In particular, even under strong mixing assumptions, the variance of the estimates computed with the  method increases at least quadratically in time. The more expensive  method relies on a nonstandard particle implementation and does not suffer from this rapid degradation. It is shown how both methods can be used to perform batch and recursive parameter estimation.},

Hierarchical priors are developed and, as the resulting posterior probability distributions and Bayesian estimators do not admit closed-form analytical expressions, reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are derived to estimate these quantities. Results are obtained for standard denoising and segmentation of speech data problems that have already been examined in the literature. These results demonstrate the performance of our methods},

  Abstract                 = {During the last years, a number of methodological papers on models with discrete parameter shifts have revived interest in the so-called regime switching models. Piecewise linear models are attractive when modelling a wide range of nonlinear system and determining simultaneously i) the data partition ii) the time instant of change iii) the parameter values of the different local models. This is a difficult problem for which no solution exists in the general case and we show here some aspects and particular results concerning the problem of off line learning of switching time series. We propose a method for identifying the parameters of the local models when choosing an adapted weighting function, this function allowing to select the data for which each local model is active. Indeed the proposed method is able to solve simultaneously the data allocation and the parameter estimation. The feasibility and the performance of the procedure is demonstrated using several academic examples.},

  Abstract                 = {We generalize the popular ensemble Kalman filter to an ensemble transform filter, in which the prior distribution can take the form of a Gaussian mixture or a Gaussian kernel density estimator. The design of the filter is based on a continuous formulation of the Bayesian filter analysis step. We call the new filter algorithm the ensemble Gaussian-mixture filter (EGMF). The EGMF is implemented for three simple test problems (Brownian dynamics in one dimension, Langevin dynamics in two dimensions and the three-dimensional Lorenz-63 model). It is demonstrated that the EGMF is capable of tracking systems with non-Gaussian uni- and multimodal ensemble distributions. Copyright © 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

This is achieved by collecting together disparate observations and derivations made by many previous authors and introducing a new way of linking discrete and continuous state models using a simple nonlinearity. Through the use of other nonlinearities, we show how independent component analysis is also a variation of the same basic generative model. We show that factor analysis and mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in autoencoder neural networks and learned using squared error plus the same regularization term. We introduce a new model for static data, known as sensible principal component analysis, as well as a novel concept of spatially adaptive observation noise. We also review some of the literature involving global and local mixtures of the basic models and provide pseudocode for inference and learning for all the basic models.},

  Abstract                 = {The theory and the applications of the marginalized particle filter (MPF) have attracted much research attention during the last decade. However, the existing MPF framework does not cover dependent process and measurement noises. This dependency is perhaps more common in practice than is acknowledged in the literature. In this article, we propose a general framework for MPF, covering both cases of dependent and independent noises. As a consequence, MPF with independent noises is a special case of this general framework. The treatment of dependency always provides `extra' information to the state estimation tasks. This beneficial effect is shown through a numerical example.},

  Abstract                 = {The particle filter provides a general solution to the nonlinear filtering problem with arbitrarily accuracy. However, the curse of dimensionality prevents its application in cases where the state dimensionality is high. Further, estimation of stationary parameters is a known challenge in a particle filter framework. We suggest a marginalization approach for the case of unknown noise distribution parameters that avoid both aforementioned problem. First, the standard approach of augmenting the state vector with sensor offsets and scale factors is avoided, so the state dimension is not increased. Second, the mean and covariance of both process and measurement noises are represented with parametric distributions, whose statistics are updated adaptively and analytically using the concept of conjugate prior distributions. The resulting marginalized particle filter is applied to and illustrated with a standard example from literature.},

Instead, a separate backward smoothing pass is used, which recursively computes corrections to the forward filtering result. The smoother equations are derived as approximations to the formal Bayesian optimal smoothing equations. The performance of the new smoother is demonstrated with a simulation.},

  Abstract                 = { The particle filter offers a general numerical tool to approximate the posterior density function for the state in nonlinear and non-Gaussian filtering problems. While the particle filter is fairly easy to implement and tune, its main drawback is that it is quite computer intensive, with the computational complexity increasing quickly with the state dimension. One remedy to this problem is to marginalize out the states appearing linearly in the dynamics. The result is that one Kalman filter is associated with each particle. The main contribution in this paper is the derivation of the details for the marginalized particle filter for a general nonlinear state-space model. Several important special cases occurring in typical signal processing applications will also be discussed. The marginalized particle filter is applied to an integrated navigation system for aircraft. It is demonstrated that the complete high-dimensional system can be based on a particle filter using marginalization for all but three states. Excellent performance on real flight data is reported.},

We introduce a sample-based variant of joint probabilistic data association filters to track features originating from individual objects and to solve the correspondence problem between the detected features and the filters. In contrast to standard methods, occlusions are handled explicitly during data association. The technique has been implemented and tested on a real robot. Experiments carried out in a typical office environment show that the method is able to track multiple persons even when the trajectories of two people are crossing each other.},

For an underlying state-space model, the EM algorithm is used in conjunction with the conventional Kalman smoothed estimators to derive a simple recursive procedure for estimating the parameters by maximum likelihood. An example is given which involves smoothing and forecasting an economic series using the maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle filters for dynamic state-space models handling unknown static parameters are discussed. The approach is based on marginalizing the static parameters out of the posterior distribution such that only the state vector needs to be considered. Such a marginalization can always be applied. However, real-time applications are only possible when the distribution of the unknown parameters given both observations and the hidden state vector depends on some low-dimensional sufficient statistics. Such sufficient statistics are present in many of the commonly used state-space models. Marginalizing the static parameters avoids the problem of impoverishment, which typically occurs when static parameters are included as part of the state vector. The filters are tested on several different models, with promising results},

  Abstract                 = {Most model-based tracking algorithms represent the temporal dynamics of a maneuver acceleration with a Markov process. The sample paths so generated may not be plausible. A renewal process model is shown to be more realistic, but a tracker based upon it is seen to be more complicated to implement. The response of the renewal-model tracker is compared with a simpler estimator based upon a Markov model both for the case in which the tracker utilizes an imager, and the case where it does not. It is shown in the latter case that performance improvement is not commensurate with algorithmic complexity. For an image-enhanced tracker, a sophisticated model of target dynamics promises significant performance improvement.<>},

  Abstract                 = {This paper extends the study of Wishart and multivariate beta distributions to the singular case, where the rank is below the dimensionality. The usual conjugacy is extended to this case. A volume element on the space of positive semidefinite m × m matrices of rank $n < m$ is introduced and some transformation properties established. The density function is found for all rank-n Wishart distributions as well as the rank-1 multivariate beta distribution. To do that, the Jacobian for the transformation to the singular value decomposition of general m × n matrices is calculated. The results in this paper are useful in particular for updating a Bayesian posterior when tracking a time-varying variance-covariance matrix.},

  Abstract                 = {Tracking ground targets with airborne GMTI (ground moving target indicator) sensor measurements proves to be a challenging task due to high target density, high clutter, and low visibility. The exploitation of nonstandard background information such as road maps and terrain information is therefore highly desirable for the enhancement of track quality and track continuity. The present paper presents a Bayesian approach to incorporate such information consistently. It is particularly suited to deal with winding roads and networks of roads. The target dynamics is modeled in quasi one-dimensional road coordinates and mapped onto ground coordinates using linear road segments taking road map errors into account. The case of several intersecting roads with different characteristics, such as mean curvature, slope, or visibility, is treated within an interacting multiple model (IMM) scheme. Targets can be masked both by the clutter notch of the sensor and by terrain obstacles. Both effects are modeled using a sensor-target state dependent detection probability. The iterative filter equations are formulated within a framework of Gaussian sum approximations on the one hand and a particle filter approach on the other hand. Simulation results for single targets taken from a realistic ground scenario show strongly reduced target location errors compared with the case of neglecting road-map information. By modeling the clutter notch of the GMTI sensor, early detection of stopping targets is demonstrated},

  Abstract                 = {Subspace-based methods for system identification have attracted much attention during the past few years. This interest is due to the ability of providing accurate state-space models for multivariable linear systems directly from input-output data. The methods have their origin in classical state-space realization theory as developed in the 1960s. The main computational tools are the \{QR\} and the singular-value decompositions. Here, an overview of existing subspace-based techniques for system identification is given. The methods are grouped into the classes of realization-based and direct techniques. Similarities between different algorithms are pointed out, and their applicability is commented upon. We also discuss some recent ideas for improving and extending the methods. A simulation example is included for comparing different algorithms. The subspace-based approach is found to perform competitive with respect to prediction-error methods, provided the system is properly excited. },

  Abstract                 = {Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are powerful techniques for online filtering of nonlinear and non-Gaussian dynamic systems. Typically dynamic systems exhibit strong memory effects, i.e., future observations can reveal substantial information about the current state. The delayed-sample sampling method has been proposed in the context of a mixture Kalman filter (MKF), which makes use of future observations in generating samples of the current state. Although this method is highly effective in producing accurate filtering results, its computational complexity is exponential in terms of the delay, due to the need to marginalize the future states. We address this difficulty by developing two new sampling schemes for delayed estimation, namely, delayed-pilot sampling and hybrid-pilot sampling. The basic idea of delayed-pilot sampling is that instead of exploring the entire space of future states, we generate a number of random pilot streams, each of which indicates what would happen in the future if the current state takes a particular value. The sampling distribution of the current state is then determined by the incremental importance weight associated with each pilot stream. The delayed-pilot sampling can be used in conjunction with the delayed-sample method, resulting in a hybrid scheme. This new sampling technique is then applied to solve the problem of adaptive detection and decoding in flat-fading communication channels. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the new low-complexity sampling techniques for delayed estimation and for comparison with the delayed-sample method},

From the numerical-integration viewpoint, various versions of Gaussian filters are only distinctive from each other in their specific treatments of approximating the multiple statistical integrations. A common base is provided for the first time to analyze and compare Gaussian filters with respect to accuracy, efficiency and stability factor. This study is expected to facilitate the selection of appropriate Gaussian filters in practice and to help design more efficient filters by employing better numerical integration methods},

  Abstract                 = {In recent work it is shown that importance sampling can be avoided in the particle filter through an innovation structure inspired by traditional nonlinear filtering combined with Mean-Field Game formalisms [9], [19]. The resulting feedback particle filter (FPF) offers significant variance improvements; in particular, the algorithm can be applied to systems that are not stable. The filter comes with an up-front computational cost to obtain the filter gain. This paper describes new representations and algorithms to compute the gain in the general multivariable setting. The main contributions are, (i) Theory surrounding the FPF is improved: Consistency is established in the multivariate setting, as well as well-posedness of the associated PDE to obtain the filter gain. (ii) The gain can be expressed as the gradient of a function, which is precisely the solution to Poisson's equation for a related MCMC diffusion (the Smoluchowski equation). This provides a bridge to MCMC as well as to approximate optimal filtering approaches such as TD-learning, which can in turn be used to approximate the gain. (iii) Motivated by a weak formulation of Poisson's equation, a Galerkin finite-element algorithm is proposed for approximation of the gain. Its performance is illustrated in numerical experiments.},

  Abstract                 = { Changepoint models are widely used to model the heterogeneity of sequential data. We present a novel sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) online expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the static parameters of such models. The SMC online EM algorithm has a cost per time which is linear in the number of particles and could be particularly important when the data is representable as a long sequence of observations, since it drastically reduces the computational requirements for implementation. We present an asymptotic analysis for the stability of the SMC estimates used in the online EM algorithm and demonstrate the performance of this scheme by using both simulated and real data originating from DNA analysis. The supplementary materials for the article are available online. },

  Abstract                 = {Joinpoint models have been applied to the cancer incidence and mortality data with continuous change points. The current estimation method [Lerman, P.M., 1980. Fitting segmented regression models by grid search. Appl. Statist. 29, 7784] assumes that the joinpoints only occur at discrete grid points. However, it is more realistic that the joinpoints take any value within the observed data range. Hudson [1966. Fitting segmented curves whose join points have to be estimated. J. Amer. Statist. Soc. 61, 10971129] provides an algorithm to find the weighted least square estimates of the joinpoint on the continuous scale. Hudson described the estimation procedure in detail for a model with only one joinpoint, but its extension to a multiple joinpoint model is not straightforward. In this article, we describe in detail Hudson's method for the multiple joinpoint model and discuss issues in the implementation. We compare the computational efficiencies of the \{LGS\} method and Hudson's method. The comparisons between the proposed estimation method and several alternative approaches, especially the Bayesian joinpoint models, are discussed. Hudson's method is implemented by C ++ and applied to the colorectal cancer incidence data for men under age 65 from \{SEER\} nine registries. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper applies a Markov chain Monte Carlo-based (MCMC) particle filter on the multiple target tracking problem. Traditional particle filters employ the sequential importance sampling/resampling method along with the MCMC move step, which is commonly used as a means to improve diversity among particles. The MCMC-based particle filter applied in this paper is distinct from the traditional particle filters in that: 1) It replaces the importance sampling with MCMC sampling and 2) the MCMC move is used as the sequential sampling method instead of simply as a means to improve diversity. By virtue of its information-centric property, the MCMC technique can automatically explore the posterior distribution at each sampling step. The benefit is that it allows the MCMC-based particle filter to track multiple targets without suffering from exponential complexity, which is the major drawback while using a traditional joint particle filter. Simulation results are presented in a bearings-only tracking problem for three targets and a Keplerian orbital tracking problem involving two targets.},
