  abstract = { The estimation of static parameters in general non-linear non-Gaussian
	state-space models is a long-standing problem. This is despite the
	advent of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, aka particle filters) methods,
	which provide very good approximations to the optimal filter under
	weak assumptions. Several algorithms based on SMC have been proposed
	in the past 10 years to solve the static parameter problem. However
	all the algorithms we are aware of suffer from the so-called `degeneracy
	problem'. We propose here a methodology for point estimation of static
	parameters which does not suffer from this problem. Our methods take
	advantage of the fact that many state space models of interest are
	ergodic and stationary: this allows us to propose contrast functions
	for the static parameter which can be consistently estimated and
	optimised using simulation-based methods. Several types of contrast
	functions are possible but we focus here on the average of a so-called
	pseudo-likelihood which we maximize using on-line Expectation-Maximization
	type algorithms. In its basic form the algorithm requires the expression
	of the invariant distribution of the underlying state process. When
	the invariant distribution is unknown, we present an alternative
	which relies on indirect inference techniques.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new nonlinear filter for high-dimensional
	state estimation, which we have named the cubature Kalman filter
	(CKF). The heart of the CKF is a spherical-radial cubature rule,
	which makes it possible to numerically compute multivariate moment
	integrals encountered in the nonlinear Bayesian filter. Specifically,
	we derive a third-degree spherical-radial cubature rule that provides
	a set of cubature points scaling linearly with the state-vector dimension.
	The CKF may therefore provide a systematic solution for high-dimensional
	nonlinear filtering problems. The paper also includes the derivation
	of a square-root version of the CKF for improved numerical stability.
	The CKF is tested experimentally in two nonlinear state estimation
	problems. In the first problem, the proposed cubature rule is used
	to compute the second-order statistics of a nonlinearly transformed
	Gaussian random variable. The second problem addresses the use of
	the CKF for tracking a maneuvering aircraft. The results of both
	experiments demonstrate the improved performance of the CKF over
	conventional nonlinear filters.},

	first conditioning on the partition and then averaging over all partitions.
	These models apply with special computational simplicity to change

	The benchmark problem involves beam pointing control of a phased

	(ECM). The testbed simulation described includes the effects of target

	broadcasting wideband noise and targets attempting range gate pull
	off (RGPO). The limits on the position and maneuverability of the
	targets are given along with descriptions of six target trajectories.

  abstract = {Two-filter smoothing is a principled approach for performing optimal
	smoothing in non-linear non-Gaussian state–space models where the
	smoothing distributions are computed through the combination of ‘forward’
	and ‘backward’ time filters. The ‘forward’ filter is the standard
	Bayesian filter but the ‘backward’ filter, generally referred to
	as the backward information filter, is not a probability measure
	on the space of the hidden Markov process. In cases where the backward
	information filter can be computed in closed form, this technical
	point is not important. However, for general state–space models where
	there is no closed form expression, this prohibits the use of flexible
	numerical techniques such as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to approximate
	the two-filter smoothing formula. We propose here a generalised two-filter
	smoothing formula which only requires approximating probability distributions
	and applies to any state–space model, removing the need to make restrictive
	assumptions used in previous approaches to this problem. SMC algorithms
	are developed to implement this generalised recursion and we illustrate
	their performance on various problems.},

	of coordinated targets. Based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
	mechanism, the new algorithm propagates a discrete approximation
	of the underlying filtering density. A dynamic Gaussian mixture model
	is utilized for representing the time-varying clustering structure.
	This involves point process formulations of typical behavioral moves
	such as birth and death of clusters as well as merging and splitting.
	Following our previous work, we adopt here two strategies for increasing
	the sampling efficiency of the basic MCMC scheme: an evolutionary
	stage which allows improved exploration of the sample space, and
	an EM-based method for making optimized proposals based on the frame
	likelihood. The algorithm's performance is assessed and demonstrated
	in both synthetic and real tracking scenarios.},

	the change-point model in terms of a latent discrete state variable

	to a discrete-time discrete-state Markov process with the transition
	probabilities constrained so that the state variable can either stay
	at the current value or jump to the next higher value. This parameterization
	exactly reproduces the change point model. The model is estimated
	by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods using an approach that is based
	on Chib (1996). This methodology is quite valuable since it allows
	for the fitting of more complex change point models than was possible
	before. Methods for the computation of Bayes factors are also developed.
	All the techniques are illustrated using simulated and real data

	particle flows, which assumed zero diffusion for the flow corresponding
	to Bayes’ rule. We emphasize, however, that all of our particle flows
	have always assumed non-zero diffusion for the dynamical model of
	the evolution of the state vector in time. Our new algorithm is simple
	and fast, and it has an especially nice intuitive formula, which
	is the same as Newton’s method to solve the maximum likelihood estimation
	(MLE) problem (but for each particle rather than only the MLE), and
	it is also the same as the extended Kalman filter for the special
	case of Gaussian densities (but for each particle rather than just
	the point estimate). All of these new flows apply to arbitrary multimodal
	densities with smooth nowhere vanishing non-Gaussian densities.},

	in signal processing, machine learning, robotics, and control for

	This modern way of system identification is more robust than finding

	Our numerical evaluations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed

	(MCMC) moves within a particle filter. Previous, similar, attempts
	have required the complete history (“trajectory”) of each particle
	to be stored. Here, it is shown how certain MCMC moves can be introduced
	within a particle filter when only summaries of each particles' trajectory
	are stored. These summaries are based on sufficient statistics. Using
	this idea, the storage requirement of the particle filter can be
	substantially reduced, and MCMC moves can be implemented more efficiently.
	We illustrate how this idea can be used for both the bearingsonly
	tracking problem and a model of stochastic volatility. We give a
	detailed comparison of the performance of different particle filters
	for the bearings-only tracking problem. MCMC, combined with a sensible
	initialization of the filter and stratified resampling, produces
	substantial gains in the efficiency of the particle filter. },

	the computational cost to linear in the number of observations, at
	the expense of introducing small errors, and we propose two new,
	optimum resampling algorithms for this problem. One, a version of
	rejection control, allows the particle filter to choose the number
	of particles that are required at each time step automatically. The
	new resampling algorithms substantially outperform standard resampling

  abstract = {Computing (ratios of) normalizing constants of probability models
	is a fundamental computational problem for many statistical and scientific
	studies. Monte Carlo simulation is an effective technique, especially
	with complex and high-dimensional models. This paper aims to bring
	to the attention of general statistical audiences of some effective
	methods originating from theoretical physics and at the same time
	to explore these methods from a more statistical perspective, through
	establishing theoretical connections and illustrating their uses
	with statistical problems. We show that the acceptance ratio method
	and thermodynamic integration are natural generalizations of importance
	sampling, which is most familiar to statistical audiences. The former
	generalizes importance sampling through the use of a single "bridge"
	density and is thus a case of bridge sampling in the sense of Meng
	and Wong. Thermodynamic integration, which is also known in the numerical
	analysis literature as Ogata's method for high-dimensional integration,
	corresponds to the use of infinitely many and continuously connected
	bridges (and thus a "path"). Our path sampling formulation offers
	more flexibility and thus potential efficiency to thermodynamic integration,
	and the search of optimal paths turns out to have close connections
	with the Jeffreys prior density and the Rao and Hellinger distances
	between two densities. We provide an informative theoretical example
	as well as two empirical examples (involving 17- to 70-dimensional
	integrations) to illustrate the potential and implementation of path
	sampling. We also discuss some open problems.},

	are often stochastic and analytically intractable, containing uncertain

	parameters of complex nonlinear multivariate stochastic process models
	is a challenging problem, but we find here that algorithms based
	on particle Markov chain Monte Carlo turn out to be a very effective
	computationally intensive approach to the problem. Approximations
	to the inferential model based on stochastic differential equations
	(SDEs) are considered, as well as improvements to the inference scheme
	that exploit the SDE structure. We apply the methodology to a Lotka–Volterra

	an intrinsic part of ensuring that the chain converges to the intended

	parts of the state space, may indicate that locally the proposal
	distribution is badly calibrated to the target. As an alternative
	to careful off-line tuning of state-dependent proposals, the basic
	algorithm can be modified so that, on rejection, a second attempt
	to move is made. A different proposal can be generated from a new
	distribution that is allowed to depend on the previously rejected
	proposal. We generalise this idea of delaying the rejection and adapting
	the proposal distribution, due to Tierney & Mira (1999), to generate
	a more flexible class of methods that applies in particular to a
	variable-dimension setting. The approach is illustrated by two pedagogical
	examples and a more realistic application to a changepoints analysis

	particle filters (sequential Monte Carlo methods) is developed. It
	consists of a class of motion models and a general nonlinear measurement
	equation in position. A general algorithm is presented, which is
	parsimonious with the particle dimension. It is based on marginalization,
	enabling a Kalman filter to estimate all position derivatives, and
	the particle filter becomes low dimensional. This is of utmost importance
	for high-performance real-time applications. Automotive and airborne
	applications illustrate numerically the advantage over classical
	Kalman filter-based algorithms. Here, the use of nonlinear models
	and non-Gaussian noise is the main explanation for the improvement
	in accuracy. More specifically, we describe how the technique of
	map matching is used to match an aircraft's elevation profile to
	a digital elevation map and a car's horizontal driven path to a street
	map. In both cases, real-time implementations are available, and
	tests have shown that the accuracy in both cases is comparable with
	satellite navigation (as GPS) but with higher integrity. Based on
	simulations, we also argue how the particle filter can be used for
	positioning based on cellular phone measurements, for integrated
	navigation in aircraft, and for target tracking in aircraft and cars.
	Finally, the particle filter enables a promising solution to the
	combined task of navigation and tracking, with possible application
	to airborne hunting and collision avoidance systems in cars},

	in regime. The parameters of an autoregression are viewed as the
	outcome of a discrete-state Markov process. For example, the mean
	growth rate of a nonstationary series may be subject to occasional,
	discrete shifts. The econometrician is presumed not to observe these

	whether and when they may have occurred based on the observed behavior
	of the series. The paper presents an algorithm for drawing such estimation

	provides the foundation for forecasting future values of the series.
	An empirical application of this technique to postwar U.S. real GNP
	suggests that the periodic shift from a positive growth rate to a
	negative growth rate is a recurrent feature of the U.S. business
	cycle, and indeed could be used as an objective criterion for defining

  abstract = { This paper is concerned with recursively estimating the internal
	state sequence of a discrete-time dynamic system by processing a
	sequence of noisy measurements taken from the system output. Recursive
	processing requires some kind of sufficient statistic for representing
	the information collected up to a certain time step. For this purpose,
	the probability density functions of the state are especially well
	suited. Once they are available, almost any type of point estimate,
	e.g. mean, mode, or median, can be derived. In the case of continuous
	states, however, the exact probability density functions characterizing
	the state estimate are in general either not feasible or not well
	suited for recursive processing. Hence, approximations of the true
	densities are generally inevitable, where Gaussian mixture approximations
	are convenient for a number of reasons. However, calculating appropriate
	mixture parameters that minimize a global measure of deviation from
	the true density is a tough optimization task. Here, we propose a
	new approximation method that minimizes the squared integral deviation
	between the true density and its mixture approximation. Rather than
	trying to solve the original problem, it is converted into a corresponding
	system of explicit ordinary first-order differential equations. This
	system of differential equations is then solved over a finite "time"
	interval, which is an efficient way of calculating the desired optimal
	parameter values. We focus on the measurement update in the important
	case of vector states and scalar measurements. In addition, approximation
	densities with separable kernels are assumed. It will be shown, that
	if the measurement nonlinearities are also separable, the required
	multidimensional integrals can be reduced to the product of one-dimensional
	integrals. For several important types of measurement functions including
	polynomial measurement nonlinearities, closed-form analytic expressions
	for the coefficients of the system of differential equations are
	available.},

	Furthermore, a general framework, including many of the particle

	be found quite easily. The exceptions to this rule are studied. The
	easiest case to handle occurs when a join point** coincides with
	an abscissa of the given data. In that case it is possible to modify
	local least squares estimates so that they satisfy an obvious linear
	constraint (the requirement that the curves do actually join there).
	If the model is not made up entirely of a mixture of straight lines
	and constants, we will deal separately with the case where the submodels
	join together with equal slopes. The solution then requires iterative
	techniques. },

  abstract = {The Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most widely used methods for
	tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability
	and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems
	can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended
	Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearizes all nonlinear models
	so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although
	the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy,
	over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus
	within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to
	implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which
	are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this
	paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using
	the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used
	to parameterize mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance
	equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalizes elegantly
	to nonlinear systems without the linearization steps required by
	the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the
	new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly
	comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is
	not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources
	are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate
	estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the
	EKF in virtually all applications.},

	transition method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are:
	(1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply
	without modifica- tion to stationary and nonstationary statistics
	and to growing-memory and infinite- memory filters. (2) A nonlinear
	difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance
	matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this
	equation the co- efficients of the difference (or differential) equation
	of the optimal linear filter are ob- tained without further calculations.
	(3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free
	regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two
	well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The
	discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles;
	basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in
	the Appendix.},

	Since nonlinear and non-Gaussian estimation problems are solved approximately

	filters, the association step is crucial for the overall performance.
	We introduce a Bayesian data association method based on the particle
	filter idea and joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) hypothesis
	calculations. A comparison with classical EKF based data association
	methods such as the nearest neighbor (NN) method and the JPDA method
	is made. The NN association method is also applied to the particle
	filter method. Multiple target tracking using particle filtering
	increases the computational burden, therefore a control structure
	for the number of samples needed is proposed. A radar target tracking
	application is used in a simulation study for evaluation.},

	laws of kinematics, with the addition of uncertainty terms in the
	form of random noise to compensate for model mismatch. Although it
	is possible to construct quite accurate models, there is a trade-off

	model accuracy. In this paper, we present a model for target motion
	that is based on a Brownian description of the target's speed and
	heading, which allows the derivation of closed form expressions for
	the exact first two moments of the propagated probability density
	function of the target's state vector. We outline the design of tracking

  abstract = {Abstract Almost all research fields in geosciences use numerical models
	and observations and combine these using data-assimilation techniques.
	With ever-increasing resolution and complexity, the numerical models
	tend to be highly nonlinear and also observations become more complicated
	and their relation to the models more nonlinear. Standard data-assimilation
	techniques like (ensemble) Kalman filters and variational methods
	like 4D-Var rely on linearizations and are likely to fail in one
	way or another. Nonlinear data-assimilation techniques are available,
	but are only efficient for small-dimensional problems, hampered by
	the so-called ‘curse of dimensionality’. Here we present a fully
	nonlinear particle filter that can be applied to higher dimensional
	problems by exploiting the freedom of the proposal density inherent
	in particle filtering. The method is illustrated for the three-dimensional
	Lorenz model using three particles and the much more complex 40-dimensional
	Lorenz model using 20 particles. By also applying the method to the
	1000-dimensional Lorenz model, again using only 20 particles, we
	demonstrate the strong scale-invariance of the method, leading to
	the optimistic conjecture that the method is applicable to realistic
	geophysical problems. Copyright © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

	incorporate a particle filter (PF) in a Markov chain Monte Carlo
	(MCMC) sampler. The resulting method was shown to be an efficient
	tool for joint Bayesian parameter and state inference in nonlinear,
	non-Gaussian state-space models. However, the mixing of the PG kernel
	can be very poor when there is severe degeneracy in the PF. Hence,
	the success of the PG sampler heavily relies on the, often unrealistic,
	assumption that we can implement a PF without suffering from any
	considerate degeneracy. However, as pointed out by Whiteley [2] in
	the discussion following [1], the mixing can be improved by adding
	a backward simulation step to the PG sampler. Here, we investigate
	this further, derive an explicit PG sampler with backward simulation
	(denoted PG-BSi) and show that this indeed is a valid MCMC method.
	Furthermore, we show in a numerical example that backward simulation
	can lead to a considerable increase in performance over the standard
	PG sampler.},

	in using the Gibbs sampler and proves from an operator theory viewpoint
	that the method is in general beneficial. The norms of the forward
	operators associated with the corresponding nonreversible Markov
	chains are used to discriminate among different simulation schemes.
	When applied to Bayesian missing data problems, the idea of collapsing
	suggests skipping the steps of sampling parameter(s) values in standard
	data augmentation. By doing this, we obtain a predictive update version
	of the Gibbs sampler. A procedure of calculating the posterior odds
	ratio via the collapsed Gibbs sampler when incomplete observations
	are involved is presented. As an illustration of possible applications,
	three examples, along with a Bayesian treatment for identifying common
	protein binding sites in unaligned DNA sequences, are provided. },

	are partial combinations of three ingredients: importance sampling
	and resampling, rejection sampling, and Markov chain iterations.
	We provide guidelines on how they should be used and under what circumstance
	each method is most suitable. Through the analysis of differences
	and connections, we consolidate these methods into a generic algorithm
	by combining desirable features. In addition, we propose a general
	use of Rao-Blackwellization to improve performance. Examples from
	econometrics and engineering are presented to demonstrate the importance
	of Rao–Blackwellization and to compare different Monte Carlo procedures.

	filter and particle filters. For a particular problem, if the assumptions
	of the Kalman filter hold, then no other algorithm can out-perform
	it. However, in a variety of real scenarios, the assumptions do not
	hold and approximate techniques must be employed. The extended Kalman
	filter approximates the models used for the dynamics and measurement
	process, in order to be able to approximate the probability density
	by a Gaussian. Particle filtering approximates the density directly
	as a finite number of samples. A number of different types of particle
	filter exist and some have been shown to outperform others when used
	for particular applications. However, when designing a particle filter
	for a particular application, it is the choice of importance density
	that is critical. These notes are of a tutorial nature and so, to
	facilitate easy implementation, 'pseudo-code' for algorithms are

  abstract = {Particle filters are an increasingly popular algorithm for tracking
	in non-linear and non-Gaussian scenarios. However, in scenarios involving
	multiple pronounced and persistent modes, particle filters can struggle
	to maintain accurate estimates of the weights associated with these
	modes. Indeed, particle filters often lose modes all together. We
	explain why this phenomenon occurs. We articulate some convergence
	results for particle filters in a context that aims to be accessible
	to engineering practitioners. We use this review of convergence results
	to argue the utility of optimised proposal distributions in multi-modal
	scenarios. We demonstrate the validity of this argument by applying
	particle filters to synthetic data where multi-modal structure is
	designed to exist but this structure is unknown to the particle filter.
	We find that optimised particle filters outperform naive particle
	filter both when the same number of particles is used and when the
	total computational cost is kept approximately constant: a smaller
	number of particles with an optimised proposal distribution can out
	perform a larger number of particles with a naive proposal distribution.
	Furthermore, the benefits derived from previous work, which explicitly
	stratifies the particle filter with the intent of improving performance
	in multi-modal scenarios, is found to be less than the benefits derived
	from using optimised proposals. We conclude that multi-modality,
	perhaps surprisingly, does not motivate a different approach to applications
	of particle filters to other challenging scenarios.},

	to multiple model techniques for tracking highly manoeuverable targets.
	The basic idea of variable rate methods is to apply local fits to
	segments of the target trajectory of variable length. Both the fit
	parameters and the length of the segments need to be estimated. Approximately
	optimal Bayesian estimation of these quantities can be performed
	using particle filters. In this paper a Rao-Blackwellised variable

	of a suitable measure-preserving map is established by formulating
	the problem in the context of optimal transport theory. We discuss
	various means of explicitly parameterizing the map and computing
	it efficiently through solution of an optimization problem, exploiting
	gradient information from the forward model when possible. The resulting
	algorithm overcomes many of the computational bottlenecks associated
	with Markov chain Monte Carlo. Advantages of a map-based representation
	of the posterior include analytical expressions for posterior moments
	and the ability to generate arbitrary numbers of independent posterior
	samples without additional likelihood evaluations or forward solves.
	The optimization approach also provides clear convergence criteria
	for posterior approximation and facilitates model selection through
	automatic evaluation of the marginal likelihood. We demonstrate the
	accuracy and efficiency of the approach on nonlinear inverse problems
	of varying dimension, involving the inference of parameters appearing

  abstract = {In this paper we present an online approach for joint detection and
	tracking for multiple targets using variable rate particle filters
	(VRPFs). Unlike conventional models and particle filters, the proposed
	method utilises the applied forces (tangential and radial components)
	to model target motions and does not assume the hidden state to change
	at the same rate as the observations. In effect not only does the
	proposed method enable us to model parsimoniously the manoeuvring
	behaviours of targets with a single dynamical model but it also provides
	a more efficient framework for recursive estimation of the targets'
	positions since much fewer states will be estimated. In addition,
	a target detection/termination module will be integrated in the proposed
	method in which a track initiation, termination, or maintenance move
	is randomly executed using Bayesian Monte Carlo methods. To model
	a more realistic observation environment Poisson process is chosen
	for all target originating and spurious measurements. Unlike other
	observation models, the proposed model does not require extensive
	computation for data association between active targets and observations,
	prior to target state estimation, as a result. To improve the quality
	of the particles we adopt a data-dependent importance sampling strategy
	in which the latest observations are involved when new particles
	are updated. This enables the target states to be updated as new
	observations arrive while keeping the number of states sufficiently
	low to track the manoeuvres of the targets. Computer simulations
	demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for detecting and
	tracking multiple highly manoeuverable targets in a hostile environment
	with high clutter density and low detection probability.},

	interest in Monte Carlo-based methods, often involving particle filters,
	for approximate smoothing in nonlinear and/or non-Gaussian state-space
	models. One such method is to approximate filter distributions using
	a particle filter and then to simulate, using backward kernels, a
	state trajectory backwards on the set of particles. We show that
	by simulating multiple realizations of the particle filter and adding
	a Metropolis-Hastings step, one obtains a Markov chain Monte Carlo
	scheme whose stationary distribution is the exact smoothing distribution.
	This procedure expands upon a similar one recently proposed by Andrieu,
	Doucet, Holenstein, and Whiteley. We also show that simulating multiple
	trajectories from each realization of the particle filter can be
	beneficial from a perspective of variance versus computation time,

	a sufficient statistic structure and the methodology can be easily
	implemented by modifying state space smoothing algorithms. We avoid
	reweighting particles and hence sample degeneracy problems that plague
	particle filters that use sequential importance sampling. The method
	is illustrated by using two examples: a benchmark auto-regressive
	model with observation error and a high dimensional dynamic spatiotemporal
	model. We show that the method provides accurate inference in the
	presence of outliers, model misspecification and high dimensionality.},

  abstract = {Tracking ground targets with airborne GMTI (ground moving target indicator)
	sensor measurements proves to be a challenging task due to high target
	density, high clutter, and low visibility. The exploitation of nonstandard
	background information such as road maps and terrain information
	is therefore highly desirable for the enhancement of track quality
	and track continuity. The present paper presents a Bayesian approach
	to incorporate such information consistently. It is particularly
	suited to deal with winding roads and networks of roads. The target
	dynamics is modeled in quasi one-dimensional road coordinates and
	mapped onto ground coordinates using linear road segments taking
	road map errors into account. The case of several intersecting roads
	with different characteristics, such as mean curvature, slope, or
	visibility, is treated within an interacting multiple model (IMM)
	scheme. Targets can be masked both by the clutter notch of the sensor
	and by terrain obstacles. Both effects are modeled using a sensor-target
	state dependent detection probability. The iterative filter equations
	are formulated within a framework of Gaussian sum approximations
	on the one hand and a particle filter approach on the other hand.
	Simulation results for single targets taken from a realistic ground
	scenario show strongly reduced target location errors compared with
	the case of neglecting road-map information. By modeling the clutter
	notch of the GMTI sensor, early detection of stopping targets is
	demonstrated},

  abstract = {Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are powerful techniques for online
	filtering of nonlinear and non-Gaussian dynamic systems. Typically
	dynamic systems exhibit strong memory effects, i.e., future observations
	can reveal substantial information about the current state. The delayed-sample
	sampling method has been proposed in the context of a mixture Kalman
	filter (MKF), which makes use of future observations in generating
	samples of the current state. Although this method is highly effective
	in producing accurate filtering results, its computational complexity
	is exponential in terms of the delay, due to the need to marginalize
	the future states. We address this difficulty by developing two new
	sampling schemes for delayed estimation, namely, delayed-pilot sampling
	and hybrid-pilot sampling. The basic idea of delayed-pilot sampling
	is that instead of exploring the entire space of future states, we
	generate a number of random pilot streams, each of which indicates
	what would happen in the future if the current state takes a particular
	value. The sampling distribution of the current state is then determined
	by the incremental importance weight associated with each pilot stream.
	The delayed-pilot sampling can be used in conjunction with the delayed-sample
	method, resulting in a hybrid scheme. This new sampling technique
	is then applied to solve the problem of adaptive detection and decoding
	in flat-fading communication channels. Simulation results are provided
	to demonstrate the performance of the new low-complexity sampling
	techniques for delayed estimation and for comparison with the delayed-sample
	method},

	This study is expected to facilitate the selection of appropriate

  abstract = {In recent work it is shown that importance sampling can be avoided
	in the particle filter through an innovation structure inspired by
	traditional nonlinear filtering combined with Mean-Field Game formalisms
	[9], [19]. The resulting feedback particle filter (FPF) offers significant
	variance improvements; in particular, the algorithm can be applied
	to systems that are not stable. The filter comes with an up-front
	computational cost to obtain the filter gain. This paper describes
	new representations and algorithms to compute the gain in the general
	multivariable setting. The main contributions are, (i) Theory surrounding
	the FPF is improved: Consistency is established in the multivariate
	setting, as well as well-posedness of the associated PDE to obtain
	the filter gain. (ii) The gain can be expressed as the gradient of
	a function, which is precisely the solution to Poisson's equation
	for a related MCMC diffusion (the Smoluchowski equation). This provides
	a bridge to MCMC as well as to approximate optimal filtering approaches
	such as TD-learning, which can in turn be used to approximate the
	gain. (iii) Motivated by a weak formulation of Poisson's equation,
	a Galerkin finite-element algorithm is proposed for approximation
	of the gain. Its performance is illustrated in numerical experiments.},

	[Lerman, P.M., 1980. Fitting segmented regression models by grid
	search. Appl. Statist. 29, 77–84] assumes that the joinpoints only
	occur at discrete grid points. However, it is more realistic that
	the joinpoints take any value within the observed data range. Hudson
	[1966. Fitting segmented curves whose join points have to be estimated.
	J. Amer. Statist. Soc. 61, 1097–1129] provides an algorithm to find
	the weighted least square estimates of the joinpoint on the continuous
	scale. Hudson described the estimation procedure in detail for a
	model with only one joinpoint, but its extension to a multiple joinpoint
	model is not straightforward. In this article, we describe in detail
	Hudson's method for the multiple joinpoint model and discuss issues
	in the implementation. We compare the computational efficiencies
	of the \{LGS\} method and Hudson's method. The comparisons between
	the proposed estimation method and several alternative approaches,
	especially the Bayesian joinpoint models, are discussed. Hudson's
	method is implemented by C ++ and applied to the colorectal cancer
	incidence data for men under age 65 from \{SEER\} nine registries.

	filter on the multiple target tracking problem. Traditional particle
	filters employ the sequential importance sampling/resampling method
	along with the MCMC move step, which is commonly used as a means
	to improve diversity among particles. The MCMC-based particle filter
	applied in this paper is distinct from the traditional particle filters
	in that: 1) It replaces the importance sampling with MCMC sampling
	and 2) the MCMC move is used as the sequential sampling method instead
	of simply as a means to improve diversity. By virtue of its information-centric
	property, the MCMC technique can automatically explore the posterior
	distribution at each sampling step. The benefit is that it allows
	the MCMC-based particle filter to track multiple targets without
	suffering from exponential complexity, which is the major drawback
	while using a traditional joint particle filter. Simulation results
	are presented in a bearings-only tracking problem for three targets
	and a Keplerian orbital tracking problem involving two targets.},
