  Abstract                 = {Statistical traffic data analysis is a hot topic in traffic management and control. In this field, current research progresses focus on analysing traffic flows of individual links or local regions in a transportation network. Less attention are paid to the global view of traffic states over the entire network, which is important for modelling large-scale traffic scenes. Our aim is precisely to propose a new methodology for extracting spatiotemporal traffic patterns, ultimately for modelling large-scale traffic dynamics, and long-term traffic forecasting. The authors attack this issue by utilising locality-preserving non-negative matrix factorisation (LPNMF) to derive low-dimensional representation of network-level traffic states. Clustering is performed on the compact LPNMF projections to unveil typical spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of network-level traffic states. The authors have tested the proposed method on simulated traffic data generated for a large-scale road network, and reported experimental results validate the ability of our approach for extracting meaningful large-scale space-time traffic patterns. Furthermore, the derived clustering results provide an intuitive understanding of spatial-temporal characteristics of traffic flows in the large-scale network and a basis for potential long-term forecasting.},
