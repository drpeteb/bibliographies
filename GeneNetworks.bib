  abstract = {Motivation: We have used state-space models (SSMs) to reverse engineer
	transcriptional networks from highly replicated gene expression profiling
	time series data obtained from a well-established model of T cell
	activation. SSMs are a class of dynamic Bayesian networks in which
	the observed measurements depend on some hidden state variables that
	evolve according to Markovian dynamics. These hidden variables can
	capture effects that cannot be directly measured in a gene expression
	profiling experiment, for example: genes that have not been included
	in the microarray, levels of regulatory proteins, the effects of
	mRNA and protein degradation, etc.Results: We have approached the
	problem of inferring the model structure of these state-space models
	using both classical and Bayesian methods. In our previous work,
	a bootstrap procedure was used to derive classical confidence intervals
	for parameters representing ‘gene–gene’ interactions over time. In
	this article, variational approximations are used to perform the
	analogous model selection task in the Bayesian context. Certain interactions
	are present in both the classical and the Bayesian analyses of these
	regulatory networks. The resulting models place JunB and JunD at
	the centre of the mechanisms that control apoptosis and proliferation.
	These mechanisms are key for clonal expansion and for controlling
	the long term behavior (e.g. programmed cell death) of these cells.Availability:

  abstract = {Computational systems biology is concerned with the development of
	detailed mechanistic models of biological processes. Such models
	are often stochastic and analytically intractable, containing uncertain
	parameters that must be estimated from time course data. In this
	article, we consider the task of inferring the parameters of a stochastic
	kinetic model defined as a Markov (jump) process. Inference for the
	parameters of complex nonlinear multivariate stochastic process models
	is a challenging problem, but we find here that algorithms based
	on particle Markov chain Monte Carlo turn out to be a very effective
	computationally intensive approach to the problem. Approximations
	to the inferential model based on stochastic differential equations
	(SDEs) are considered, as well as improvements to the inference scheme
	that exploit the SDE structure. We apply the methodology to a Lotka–Volterra
	system and a prokaryotic auto-regulatory network.},

  abstract = {This article deals with the identification of gene regulatory networks
	from experimental data using a statistical machine learning approach.
	A stochastic model of gene interactions capable of handling missing
	variables is proposed. It can be described as a dynamic Bayesian
	network particularly well suited to tackle the stochastic nature
	of gene regulation and gene expression measurement. Parameters of
	the model are learned through a penalized likelihood maximization
	implemented through an extended version of EM algorithm. Our approach
	is tested against experimental data relative to the S.O.S. DNA Repair
	network of the Escherichia coli bacterium. It appears to be able
	to extract the main regulations between the genes involved in this
	network. An added missing variable is found to model the main protein
	of the network. Good prediction abilities on unlearned data are observed.
	These first results are very promising: they show the power of the
	learning algorithm and the ability of the model to capture gene interactions.Keywords:
