  Abstract                 = {Motivation: We have used state-space models (SSMs) to reverse engineer transcriptional networks from highly replicated gene expression profiling time series data obtained from a well-established model of T cell activation. SSMs are a class of dynamic Bayesian networks in which the observed measurements depend on some hidden state variables that evolve according to Markovian dynamics. These hidden variables can capture effects that cannot be directly measured in a gene expression profiling experiment, for example: genes that have not been included in the microarray, levels of regulatory proteins, the effects of mRNA and protein degradation, etc.Results: We have approached the problem of inferring the model structure of these state-space models using both classical and Bayesian methods. In our previous work, a bootstrap procedure was used to derive classical confidence intervals for parameters representing ‘gene–gene’ interactions over time. In this article, variational approximations are used to perform the analogous model selection task in the Bayesian context. Certain interactions are present in both the classical and the Bayesian analyses of these regulatory networks. The resulting models place JunB and JunD at the centre of the mechanisms that control apoptosis and proliferation. These mechanisms are key for clonal expansion and for controlling the long term behavior (e.g. programmed cell death) of these cells.Availability: Supplementary data is available at http://public.kgi.edu/wild/index.htm and Matlab source code for variational Bayesian learning of SSMs is available at http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/mbeal/software.htmlContact: David_Wild@kgi.edu},

  Abstract                 = {Exponential random graph models are extremely difficult models to handle from a statistical viewpoint, since their normalising constant, which depends on model parameters, is available only in very trivial cases. We show how inference can be carried out in a Bayesian framework using a \{MCMC\} algorithm, which circumvents the need to calculate the normalising constants. We use a population \{MCMC\} approach which accelerates convergence and improves mixing of the Markov chain. This approach improves performance with respect to the Monte Carlo maximum likelihood method of Geyer and Thompson (1992). },

  Abstract                 = { Undirected graphical models are widely used in statistics, physics, and machine vision. However, Bayesian parameter estimation for undirected models is extremely challenging, since evaluation of the posterior typically involves the calculation of an intractable normalizing constant. This problem has received much attention, but very little of this has focused on the important practical case where the data consist of noisy or incomplete observations of the underlying hidden structure. This article specifically addresses this problem, comparing two alternate methodologies. In the first of these approaches, particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (Andrieu, Doucet, and Holenstein) is used to efficiently explore the parameter space, combined with the exchange algorithm (Murray, Ghahramani, and MacKay) for avoiding the calculation of the intractable normalizing constant (a proof showing that this combination targets the correct distribution is given in Appendix A available in the online supplementary materials). This approach is compared with approximate Bayesian computation (Pritchard et al.). Applications to estimating the parameters of Ising models and exponential random graphs from noisy data are presented. Each algorithm used in the article targets an approximation to the true posterior due to the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) to simulate from the latent graphical model, in lieu of being able to do this exactly, in general. Appendix B (online supplementary materials) also describes the nature of the resulting approximation. Supplementary materials for this article are available online. },

  Abstract                 = {Computational systems biology is concerned with the development of detailed mechanistic models of biological processes. Such models are often stochastic and analytically intractable, containing uncertain parameters that must be estimated from time course data. In this article, we consider the task of inferring the parameters of a stochastic kinetic model defined as a Markov (jump) process. Inference for the parameters of complex nonlinear multivariate stochastic process models is a challenging problem, but we find here that algorithms based on particle Markov chain Monte Carlo turn out to be a very effective computationally intensive approach to the problem. Approximations to the inferential model based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are considered, as well as improvements to the inference scheme that exploit the SDE structure. We apply the methodology to a Lotka–Volterra system and a prokaryotic auto-regulatory network.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract A geometrically inspired matrix algorithm is derived for the identification of statespace models for multivariable linear time-invariant systems using (possibly noisy) input-output (I/O) measurements only. As opposed to other (mostly stochastic) identification schemes, no variance-covariance information whatever is involved, and only a limited number of I/O-data are required for the determination of the system matrices. Hence, the algorithm can be best described and understood in the matrix formalism, and consists of the following two steps. First, a state vector sequence is realized as the intersection of the row spaces of two block Hankel matrices, constructed with I/O-data. Then the system matrices are obtained at once from the least-squares solution of a set of linear equations. When dealing with noisy data, this algorithm draws its excellent performance from repeated use of the numerically stable and accurate singular value decomposition. Also, the algorithm is easily applied to slowly time-varying systems using windowing or exponential weighting. These results are illustrated by examples, including the identification of an industrial plant. },

  Abstract                 = {This article deals with the identification of gene regulatory networks from experimental data using a statistical machine learning approach. A stochastic model of gene interactions capable of handling missing variables is proposed. It can be described as a dynamic Bayesian network particularly well suited to tackle the stochastic nature of gene regulation and gene expression measurement. Parameters of the model are learned through a penalized likelihood maximization implemented through an extended version of EM algorithm. Our approach is tested against experimental data relative to the S.O.S. DNA Repair network of the Escherichia coli bacterium. It appears to be able to extract the main regulations between the genes involved in this network. An added missing variable is found to model the main protein of the network. Good prediction abilities on unlearned data are observed. These first results are very promising: they show the power of the learning algorithm and the ability of the model to capture gene interactions.Keywords: gene regulatory networks, structure extraction, expression profiles, dynamic Bayesian networks, Kalman filter, penalized likelihood, EM algorithm.Contact: perrin@poleia.lip6.fr },
