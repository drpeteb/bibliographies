Parallel algorithms are shown which solve block second order linear recurrences without using commutativity. Moreover we investigate the parallel solution of the associated block tridiagonal linear system. Using this theoretical background, the implementation of the algorithms is analyzed both on a small number of processors and on a hypercube. The resulting complexity is given in terms of parallel steps, each consisting of block operations, and the cost due to interprocessor communications is taken into account, too.},

  Abstract                 = {Efficient algorithms for the inversion of symmetric tridiagonal matrices are obtained. The results were published in [1].
Tridiagonal matrices are used not only in the application of finite difference methods to boundary value problems for second-order differential equations [2], but also in the solution of problems of nuclear physics [3]. Hence there is great interest in economical methods for the inversion of highorder band matrices by computer.
In this paper efficient algorithms for the inversion of symmetric tridiagonal matrices are obtained. The methods of inversion obtained are compared with other methods. The theorem proved is useful for the solution in analytic form of the problem of processing physical information about the motion of charged particles in bubble chambers [4].},

  Abstract                 = {State space methods have proven indispensable in neural data analysis. However, common methods for performing inference in state-space models with non-Gaussian observations rely on certain approximations which are not always accurate. Here we review direct optimization methods that avoid these approximations, but that nonetheless retain the computational efficiency of the approximate methods. We discuss a variety of examples, applying these direct optimization techniques to problems in spike train smoothing, stimulus decoding, parameter estimation, and inference of synaptic properties. Along the way, we point out connections to some related standard statistical methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we note that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are exploiting involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close by discussing some applications of this more general point of view, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for neural decoding and efficient estimation of spatially-varying firing rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantum transport models for nanodevices using the non-equilibrium Green’s function method require the repeated calculation of the block tridiagonal part of the Green’s and lesser Green’s function matrices. This problem is related to the calculation of the inverse of a sparse matrix. Because of the large number of times this calculation needs to be performed, this is computationally very expensive even on supercomputers. The classical approach is based on recurrence formulas which cannot be efficiently parallelized. This practically prevents the solution of large problems with hundreds of thousands of atoms. We propose new recurrences for a general class of sparse matrices to calculate Green’s and lesser Green’s function matrices which extend formulas derived by Takahashi and others. We show that these recurrences may lead to a dramatically reduced computational cost because they only require computing a small number of entries of the inverse matrix. Then, we propose a parallelization strategy for block tridiagonal matrices which involves a combination of Schur complement calculations and cyclic reduction. It achieves good scalability even on problems of modest size.},

  Abstract                 = {A method for the inversion of block tridiagonal matrices encountered in electronic structure calculations is developed, with the goal of efficiently determining the matrices involved in the Fisher–Lee relation for the calculation of electron transmission coefficients. The new method leads to faster transmission calculations compared to traditional methods, as well as freedom in choosing alternate Green’s function matrix blocks for transmission calculations. The new method also lends itself to calculation of the tridiagonal part of the Green’s function matrix. The effect of inaccuracies in the electrode self-energies on the transmission coefficient is analyzed and reveals that the new algorithm is potentially more stable towards such inaccuracies.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently there is a growing interest in semiseparable matrices and generalized semiseparable matrices. To gain an appreciation of the historical evolution of this concept, we present in this paper an extensive list of publications related to the field of semiseparable matrices. It is interesting to see that semiseparable matrices were investigated in different fields, e.g., integral equations, statistics, vibrational analysis, independently of each other. Also notable is the fact that leading statisticians at that time used semiseparable matrices without knowing their inverses to be tridiagonal. During this historical evolution the definition of semiseparable matrices has always been a difficult point leading to misunderstandings; sometimes they were defined as the inverses of irreducible tridiagonal matrices leading to generator representable matrices, while in other cases they were defined as matrices having low rank blocks below the diagonal. In this overview we present a list of interesting results which contributed to the evolution of the concept of semiseparable matrices as we now know them.},
